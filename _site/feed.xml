Instructor: Surya Banerjee
Location: DC 1350

&lt;h2 id=&quot;may-2-2016---lecture-1&quot;&gt;May 2, 2016 - Lecture 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email: s22baner@uwaterloo.ca or suryabanerjee@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course Marking Scheme: 3 Tutorial Quizzes (TQ) and 2 Midterms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STAT 231 is the reverse of STAT 230. E.g. We toss a coin 100 times, we get 60 heads. In STAT 230, we calculate the probability of that happening (binomial distribution, 100 and 0.5, P(X=60)) with all the parameters given (P = 0.5 to get a head for a fair coin). In STAT 231, we try to find the parameters by experiments, and try to infer what we can say about the “fairness” of the coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MLB: Between 1901-1941, batters with BA .400+: 11. 1941 onwards: 0. Why? Use statistics to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansas Weathermen: They are correct about whether it will rain the next day about 85% of the time. Good record, right? However, it only rains about 10% of the time in Kansas. So if I go to the weather broadcasting station and say “no rain tomorrow” and then go home, I will be statistically more accuarate that these meteorologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseball Pundits: Pundits are right about the outcome of baseball games about 48% of the time. Literally worse than a coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In STAT 231, we learn how to test claims and check for correlation and causation. How can we make the leap from correlation to causation? (Recommended reading: Freakanomics)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-to-data-analysis&quot;&gt;Introduction to Data Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data can be classified into two categories: numerical and categorical (non-numerical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numerical Data&lt;/strong&gt; is either discrete or continuous. Discrete data (e.g. number of accidents) takes integer values, while continuous data (e.g. height, weight) measure non-integer values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categorical Data&lt;/strong&gt; is either ordinal (if there’s an underlying order, e.g. on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being least satisfied and 10 being most satisfied) or non-ordinal (no order, e.g. nationality, favorite color).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformation&lt;/strong&gt; {x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,…, x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;
y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is a transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An affine transformation is a linear transformation: y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = ax&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding&lt;/strong&gt; is the conversion of categorical data into numerical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-summaries&quot;&gt;Data Summaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to extract important information about data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Numerical: come up with numbers that represent different properties of the data set&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graphical: graph that tells us the shape of the data set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some properties of interest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centre of the data set -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Central Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How volatile is the data set -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dispersion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the data set is symmetric -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Measures of Symmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How “fat” the tails of the data set are (i.e. the size of extrema) -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kurtosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measures-of-central-tendency&quot;&gt;Measures of Central Tendency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data set: {y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,…, y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample Mean:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property: The sum of the deviations of the observations from the sample mean is 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geometric Mean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmonic Mean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PSYCH 101 - Introductory Psychology</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;PSYCH 101 - Introductory Psychology
Instructor: Dr. John Campbell
Location: AL 116
Time: Mondays 6:30pm - 9:20pm
Term: Spring 2016
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;may-2-2016---lecture-1&quot;&gt;May 2, 2016 - Lecture 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychology = Study of the behaviour and the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Behaviour = actions and responses
Mind = internal states and processes, such as thoughts and feelings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychology is a science. It is a systematic gathering and evaluating of empirical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subfields: Biopsychology, developmental, experimental, industrial-organizational, personality, social etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Central Goals of Psychology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describe how people and animals behave&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explain and understand causes of these behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predict behaviours under certain conditions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influence/Control behaviours through knowledge and control of its causes to enhance human welfare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychology can be made up of different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-structuralism-perspective&quot;&gt;The Structuralism Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilhelm Wundt -&amp;gt; First psychology lab with Titchener -&amp;gt; Founded the &lt;strong&gt;Structuralism&lt;/strong&gt; approach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mind -&amp;gt; studied by breaking it into basic components&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Used “introspection” to study sensations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gave way to &lt;strong&gt;functionalism&lt;/strong&gt; (functions of consciousness)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Describe inner experiences”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-functionalism-perspective&quot;&gt;The Functionalism Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our hands -&amp;gt; “Why do we have hands”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask similar questions about mental processes and behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-psychodynamic-perspective&quot;&gt;The Psychodynamic Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Searches for causes of behaviours within the inner workings of our personality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emphasizes the role of consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychoanalysis&lt;/strong&gt; is the analysis of internal and primarily unconscious psychological forces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-behavioural-perspective&quot;&gt;The Behavioural Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focuses on the role of the external environment in governing our actions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;John Locke -&amp;gt; Tabula Rasa -&amp;gt; Human nature is shaped by our environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notable figures: Pavlov, Thorndike, Watson (Little Albert experiment), Skinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-humanistic-perspective&quot;&gt;The Humanistic Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emphasizes free will, personal growth, self-actualization, and the attempt to find meaning in one’s existence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rejects psychodynamics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Postive Psychology Movement&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; focusing on strengths and fulfillments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notable figures: Maslow (Hierarchy of Needs), Rogers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-cognitive-perspective&quot;&gt;The Cognitive Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examines nature of mind&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perceptions are organized so that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How mental processes influence behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notable figures: Ebbinghaus -&amp;gt; Gestalt Psychology (1920s)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gestalt&lt;/strong&gt; = perception and problem solving
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;figure-ground&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;closure&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;proximity&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;similarity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;modern-cognitive-psychology&quot;&gt;Modern Cognitive Psychology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notable figure: Elizabeth Loftus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Misinformation Effect&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; Impacts eyewitness memory and testimony&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Factors can distort memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading Scheme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assignments - 0(A0) 7 7 7 7 12(project) = 40%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midterm (4:30pm - 6:20pm, June 23 (Th), 2016) = 20%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final = 40%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course requires you to work in Linux. There are several options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lab machines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Linux on your own machines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make SSH connection to school machines (Use Putty (putty.exe) on Windows, winscp for file transfer, XMing for Xwindows)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download cygwin - Linux-like environment for Windows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Modules in this Course:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux Shell (2 weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;C++ Language, C++14 (10 weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software Engineering (design etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Homework”: Go on Piazza -&amp;gt; Linux Reference Sheet -&amp;gt; Save and print&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;module-1-linux-shell&quot;&gt;Module 1: Linux Shell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shell is an interface to the operating system, i.e. how we get the OS to do things (run programs, manage files etc.). There are two kinds of shells: graphical (with icons and clicking) and the command line. The shell we will use is Bash. Check if you are using Bash, login to shell and type in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ echo $0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should return “bash”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux file system: working with files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cat&lt;/strong&gt; - short for concatenate; display contents of a file (e.g. cat user/share/dict/words). In Linux, a directory is considered a special kind of file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ls&lt;/strong&gt; - list files in the current directory (non-hidden files)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ls -a&lt;/strong&gt; - list all files (including hidden; hidden files start with a “.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pwd&lt;/strong&gt; - print current directory (pwd = print working directory)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when we only type in “cat”? It just kind of sits there, waiting for input. It’s kinda like a parrot, repeating what you typed in. If we can capture the output into a file…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cat &amp;gt; output.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would capture the input. NOT RECOMMENDED: ^C. It would prevent cat from doing clean-up. Let it finish on its own: ^D at the beginning of a line sends an “EOF” signal to cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One greater than sign replaces, two appends.&lt;br /&gt;
In general, command args &amp;gt; file
executes command args + captures the output in file -&amp;gt; called &lt;strong&gt;output redirection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using less than sign, takes in input from the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cat &amp;lt; output.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line above displays the file. Seems to be equivalent to what we have before. Are these two things the same? NO. The reason is very important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cat input.txt -&amp;gt; passes the NAME input.txt to cat as an argument. Cat opens input.txt and displays its contents&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cat &amp;lt; input.txt -&amp;gt; the shell opens the file and passes the contents to cat IN PLACE of keyboard input&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wc&lt;/strong&gt; - word count, displays numbers of lines, words, and characters of a file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cat *.txt&lt;/strong&gt; - *.txt globbing pattern&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;propositional-logic&quot;&gt;Propositional Logic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOGIC = systematic study of the principles of reasoning and inference&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To model the computer hardware, software, and embedded systems we create/encounter, in order to reason about those objects in a rigorous manner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To understand how to develop systems that can themselves apply reason and make inferences (AI)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To define a computer required logic (Turing 1936)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CS gave the first definition of “rigorous argument” (an argument that may be checked by a machine; machine returns true if proof is correct)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; If the train arrives late and there are no taxis at the station, then John is late for his meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John is not late for his meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train did arrive late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore&lt;/strong&gt;, there were taxis at the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: Is this argument &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt;? Why/Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: What is the structure of this argument?&lt;br /&gt;
A: If p and not q, then r. Not r. p. Therefore q.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p = “the train arrives late”&lt;br /&gt;
q = “there are taxis at the station”&lt;br /&gt;
r = “John is late for his meeting”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we reassign meanings to p, q, and r? We will get an equally valid argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factual content of statements (p, q, r) doesn’t matter. The relationships among the statements govern the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what constitutes a “statement”?&lt;br /&gt;
What do logical relationships mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall start with &lt;strong&gt;Propositional Logic&lt;/strong&gt;, a basic form of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;proposition&lt;/strong&gt; is a declarative sentence that is either &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either the proposition is true, or the proposition is false. It is never both true and false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. If Kathleen Wynne is a Liberal, then Stephen Harper is a Tory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p-&amp;gt;q: If p then q; p is sufficient for q, q is necessary for p.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; q: p if and only if q (p iff q); p is equivalent to q; p exactly if q; p is necessary and sufficient for q.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating from English to propositional logic examples:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She is clever and hard-working&lt;br /&gt;
Let p be “she is clever” and q be “she is hard-working”&lt;br /&gt;
Then we get (p ^ q)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If he does not study hard then he will fail&lt;br /&gt;
Let p be “he studies hard” and q be “he will fail”&lt;br /&gt;
Then we get ((NOT p) -&amp;gt; q)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it rains, he will be at home; otherwsie he will go to the market or to school.&lt;br /&gt;
Let p be “it rains”, q be “he will be at home”, r be “he will go to the market”, s be “he will go to school”&lt;br /&gt;
Then we get ((p -&amp;gt; q) ^ ((NOT p) -&amp;gt; (r v s)))&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sentences are not propositions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;interrogative: where shall we go to eat?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;imperative: please pass the salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ambiguous: time flies like an arrow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nonsense: uwgod&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;otherwise problematic: This sentence is false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Life Before University &amp; [Admission] How I Got into Waterloo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Time flies at university. High school already feels like ages ago, seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I feel that I had a lot of crazy ideas when I was younger. Before deciding to go in to computer science, I really wanted to go into biology and become a pharmacologist. It all started in the summer of 2013, when I took the grade 11 level biology class in summer school in Vancouver. We got to dissect frogs, earthworms, and sashimi grade squids. Almost everyone else there was repelled by the scents of preserving alcohol and food remnants in the specimen’s cavities. Except me. I thoroughly enjoyed it. During a field trip to the Vancouver General Hospital Disease Centre, I was the only one daring to look at a severed toe infected by gout. It was truly intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People told me that “biology is not a real science” because most of it is, supposedly, just rote memorization of obscure Latin and Greek names of phyla and proteins. But I didn’t think so, and finished the entire curriculum of grade 12 biology on my own in just two weeks after summer was over. Then I found out about the National Biology Competition hosted by the University of Toronto, and promptly signed up for it. For the next two months, I read university textbooks on biochemistry, evolution, and cell biology, and in my free time, I watched YouTube videos made by high school biology teachers. I was ranked 106th in the country in the competition. I found a volunteering job as a museum educator at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beatymuseum.ubc.ca&quot;&gt;Beaty Biodiversity Museum&lt;/a&gt; at the University of British Columbia (UBC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also very interested in filmmaking in grade 11 and took the film and drama course. Here’s my very first short film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;740&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Igydkgl4FdQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;admission&quot;&gt;[Admission]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know how competitive university application was until the end of grade 11. Before that, I thought a high 80 would suffice for most top Canadian universities, at least that’s what was advertised on most university pamphlets and viewbooks. But during the summer before my grade 12 year, I stumbled upon the StudentAwards forum (now called Yconic) and was absolutely terrified by the “Admission Average” threads. Apparently the (rumored) cutoff for CS was 93%? That’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I worked my butt off in grade 12, aiming for both Software Engineering (SE, another great program) and Computer Science (CS) at UW. Admission averages are calculated differently for these programs, though. SE requires 6 BC academic courses, and 5 of them have to be English 12, Pre-Calculus 12, Calculus 12, Physics 12, and Chemistry 12. On the other hand, CS is much more lenient in terms of required courses. You only need English 12, Pre-Calculus 12, Calculus 12, and two other academically accepted courses (in my case, I picked Biology 12 and Computer Programming 12).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Chronicle of My First Year @ UW</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote the last exam (GER 101) of my first year at Waterloo two days ago. I was busy moving out or rez yesterday, and I just got some of my 1B marks on Quest. Thought I should write a blog post to wrap up my first year at UW. It was pretty lit: met a bunch of cool kids, joined a handful of clubs, played intramurals, pulled an (almost) all-nighter, got smashed twice, and had tons of fun in (some of) my classes while studying my butt off in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/1a-snow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RCH&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;RCH (left) is my favorite building, because it’s always empty late at night (I’m looking at you, QNC), and I can enjoy a few hours of solitary studying time there every day.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from high school to university was easier and smoother than I thought. Before coming to university, I heard a lot of scary things about the workload in first year, especially many MATH 135 horror stories. But everything turned out fine, thankfully. And I honestly really like the campus. There is something I like about the campus being enclosed by Ring Road and constantly patrolled by geese. It’s not as big and nice as UBC, but it feels intimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university residence I picked (UWP) was not that nice though. The room is really small and the walls aren’t soundproof. There was also a pretty serious ant infection in our unit, which was really annoying. But living on campus in first year was definitely worth it! Because there are so many co-op sequences in Math and Engineering, some of us will eventually be off-stream (i.e. I will be on co-op while some friends will have a study term, and vice versa), and first year is really (sadly) our only chance to meet people from all sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/1a-welcome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Warrior Welcome&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;I am not gonna lie, I was pretty pumped after the ceremony!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a frequent lurker on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo&quot;&gt;/r/uwaterloo&lt;/a&gt; even before I got accepted into UW, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what my first semester would be like. But you have to actually experience it to know what it’s really like. Almost lost my voice during Orientation Week from constantly screaming, laughing, and cheering. Exploring campus and bantering about baseball with people in my orientation group were great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember on the first day of classes I woke up an hour before my first lecture and wore a black Waterloo hoodie feeling like a smarty. After my first midterm, I finally realized that I am not in high school anymore. I also learned that sprinting from MC to PAS in 10 minutes is not fun, and that employer info sessions are where I get free sunglasses, keychains, and T-shirts (JK people actually go there for the free food).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played in the intramural slo-pitch league and in my first game, struck out with the bases loaded (2-4 for the day though). For some weird reason, I started a habit of working on my CS assignments on Friday night till 3 in the morning in Grand Commons, and waking up at 3pm the next day still feeling exhausted. I went to Mr. Paninos for real and really loved their beef noodles, and then proceeded to eat there for the rest of the week. NOT a good idea. I feel like throwing up whenever I see a Panino meme on Reddit now. I tried out almost all the restaurants in the plaza (RIP Panda King I will miss you forever), and fell in love with the $1.99 BK nuggets. I felt like a total noob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked really hard this term. Got the wake-up call after my first midterm, started doing assignments the day they were assigned and reading relevant materials the day before class. So I managed to get decent grades, but I think I should’ve gone out more and tried to meet more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/1a-schedule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1A Schedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;math-135&quot;&gt;MATH 135&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Did pretty well, and getting 98% on my second-ever university exam was an amazing feeling. Had to Work through hard proof assignment questions like there’s no tomorrow though. I was really keen and sat in the first row every single class. That’s my philosophy: always sit in the front. Proving something like there are infinite number of primes and whether 2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;+3&lt;sup&gt;315&lt;/sup&gt; is divisble by 7 were definitely highlights of this course as well. The prof, Ian, was awesome and made the class very enjoyable for me. The final was not hard and similar to the sample final they gave us. Carmen Bruni’s final exam Twitch stream on MATH 135 was the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;math-137&quot;&gt;MATH 137&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Eden literally taught this course in sarcasm. Hilarious prof. I already learned derivatives and integrations back in high school so this course is mostly review, but this course was still pretty interesting. I like how Eden asked us to never forget to write “By Limit Laws”, but then promptly forgot it himself while doing examples. Midterm was unexpectedly hard, but the final was alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cs-135&quot;&gt;CS 135&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really enjoy coding in Racket (a dialect of Scheme) until after the second midterm. But boy, foldr and lambdas are love. Functional programming is something truly special and amazing, I have to say. When recursion becomes your second nature, you will really appreciate its elegance. The assignments are really wordy though, and don’t even get me started on lambda tracing. It’s just so tedious. Dr Racket became a meme on the CS 135 Facebook group, and Dave Tompkins (a.k.a Quest God, Dancin’ DJ Dave) achieved celebrity status for his dank CS jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engl-109&quot;&gt;ENGL 109&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly standard communication course. Apparently starting from this year (Fall 2015) all Math and CS kids have to take two communication courses before they graduate, which I think is a good idea. This course is mostly essay writing (we wrote 3 major essays over the term, and some smaller written exercises), and the prof was very enthusiastic about teaching. I really liked the technical report assignment, where I got to talk about the differences between objected-oriented and functional programming using layperson’s terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;econ-101&quot;&gt;ECON 101&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh the fabled “ultimate bird course”. Its honestly not that birdy, you still need to put in the effort to read the study guide and do the multiple choice questions in order to do well on exams. But yes, it’s mostly rote memoriztaion, though some concepts like game theory are very interesting. I think it did teach me some economic literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;b&quot;&gt;1B&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a lot relaxed and confident after my 1A term, so I signed up for 6 courses this term. It was definitely more work than I anticipated, but it was worth it. I met a lot of people in the UWCLEC Russian Club and had tons of fun. We would all bring food and drinks to the Russian tutor’s place in UWP and have small potlucks basically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/1b-schedule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1B Schedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;math-136&quot;&gt;MATH 136&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEME 136! MATH 136 will always be a part of me: Yongqiang “Yeezus” Zhao, the definition of a basis (“Whaaaat, is the definition of a baaaasis?” “A linearly independent spanning set!” “Wow, that was beautiful!”), “plug into a matrix and row reduce”, Wolfram Alpha, and Dan Wolczuk (a.k.a Dr Dan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even compiled a “MATH 136 in a nutshell” (basically all the catchphrases we use while proving theorems):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“It is intuitively obvious that…”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Clearly/Obviously”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Immediately true by inspection, as required. ∎”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Without loss of generality (WLOG Moite)”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Similarly, same argument applies”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“By the System-Rank Theorem”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Trivial” you know what’s trivial? c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  = … =
c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  = 0 as n approaches infinity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh fun times. Linear algebra gets extremely abstract sometimes, but in the end everything made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;math-138&quot;&gt;MATH 138&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made a “MATH 138 in a nutshell”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Eventually, for large n, an/bn &amp;lt; 1” Hand-wavvvvvy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Counterexample: let an = 1/n, bn = 1/n, cn = 1/n…”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Upper bound of error, by Taylor’s Inequality is above 9001, since 9001 &amp;gt;= (0.0001)^5*(1/e)^6/6!” Yo you gotta have le equal sign bruh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“It diverges since it is the harmonic series” Jordy Hams be like first published in 1962&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“It converges since it is the alternating harmonic series”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“By IBP/Ratio Test/Limit Comparison Test”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“(2n-1)(2n-3)…(5)(3)(1) for n from 0 to infinity”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“DO NOT EVALUATE THE INTEGRAL” PRAISE THE LORD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“DO NOT USE L’HOPITAL’S RULE” U WOT M8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Use the washer/disk method”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Include all initial conditions”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“1+½^2+⅓^2+… = pi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/6” (TRIGGERED)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“It is a telescoping series…”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RATIO TEST RETURNS 1 and LIMIT COMPARISON TEST RETURNS INFINITY -&amp;gt; TURBOTRIGGERED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculus 2: basically a continuation of MATH 137 (Calculus 1). Lots of sequences, series, and Taylor polynomials, mixed with some easy proofs. Probably my last calculus class in undergrad, if I choose not to take upper year Statistics courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cs-136&quot;&gt;CS 136&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly easy intro course to C. Definitely not as fun as CS 135 to be honest. We learned some basic data structures (Arrays, binary trees, linked lists etc.), algorithms (Quicksort, mergesort), and the C memory model. Assignments were pretty boring and tedious, and memory leaks caused me some trouble. The Russian Club afterparties would sometimes turn into code parties (awks). Only fun stuff I remember about this course is that my prof was basically constanly bashing the slides for poor style and code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engl-119&quot;&gt;ENGL 119&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENGL 119 wasn’t interesting at all. Did learn some useful presentation techniques and aspects of technical writing, but it was so disorganized. Second mandatory communication course. Now I think about it, I should’ve sticked it out and kept Public Speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ger-101&quot;&gt;GER 101&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty chill class. Prof was chill. Kinda felt like a high school French class. The video project was awesome. We had to move two monitors back and forth for three straight days, and we didn’t have a tripod or anything fancy to film it properly, but it was worth it. I feel that I could’ve learned more German from this class (I really liked the in-class activities). Midterm and final were both very short and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stat-230&quot;&gt;STAT 230&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite course this term by far. Really enjoyed learning all the random variable distributions and argument counting techniques. This course made me interested in data science, analytics, and just statistics in general. Diana is a great prof, and we made the negative binomial distribution into a meme. The final was way harder than I anticipated, but still managed a decent overall mark.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Go Tutorial 2&amp;#58 The Basics (Part 1 - Etiquettes)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So starting from this tutorial, you will learn the basic etiquettes and rules of Go. Trust me, Go is way easier to learn than chess (at least the basics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;etiquettes&quot;&gt;Etiquettes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So etiquettes are huge in Go. Basically be humble, respect your opponent, don’t brag or showboat when you win. But there are also a bunch of formalities you need to keep in mind while playing Go. Typically, these etiquettes are strictly followed in Japan by all Japanese players, while in China they only serve as a general guideline. However, in the professional world, all the players practice these etiquettes without fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-game&quot;&gt;Before Game:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nigiri (Chinese: 猜子 caizi, lit. “guessing stones”; Japanese: ニギリ nigiri, lit. “grabbing (stones)”):&lt;/strong&gt; There needs to be a fair way to decide who plays first (black), if the two players are of the same rank, and Nigiri is the answer. If both players are of the same rank, the game is said to be Tagai-sen (Chinese: 互先 huxian, lit. “mutually first”; Japanese: 互い先, tagaisen, lit. “mutually first”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigiri is equivalent to flipping a coin. How it works is this: One player (almost always the older of the two players) grabs a handful of white (always) stones and puts his clinched hand on the centre of the Go board. The other player would have to guess the parity (odd or even) of the number of stones hidden in the fist of the player, by placing either one (for odd) or two (for even) black stone(s) on the Go board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first player would then release all the white stones in his hand, and both players would count them. If the player guesses the parity correctly, then it is customary for him/her to take black stones (although under some rules, such as Ing or in amateur games, the player can also choose his/her preferred color instead. I’ve only done that once, choosing white instead of black after I won the Nigiri. But I was later scolded by my teacher later. This is not recommended)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the players are not of the same rank, the player with the lower rank automatically gets to play black if their ranks differ by 1 or 2, and if the rank discrepency exceeds 2, then there is a set of rules for giving out handicap stones. Also,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Will the Jays Pitchers Do This Year?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ballgame.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rogers Centre&quot; /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;BP before my first Jays game, September 1, 2015. Ryan Goins hit a walk-off homerun later that game.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So the 2016 MLB Season is now underway.The Toronto Blue Jays are now 5-7 and trailing the Orioles (8-2) and Red Sox (6-4). I couldn’t go to the Jays home opener unfortunately, because of my hectic final exam schedule. But now that exams are (almost) over, here’s my opinion on the Jays pitching staff and how they will perform this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;starting-pitchers&quot;&gt;Starting Pitchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcus Stroman&lt;/strong&gt;: I can see him having a stellar season after last year’s outstanding performance in the postseason. He had an astonishing 239 ERA+ last season (although a fairly small sample size), and his fielding abilities, athleticism, and passion are valuable assets to the Jays. His sinker has a really good movement that makes me wow every time. He is the true ace of this team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prediction: 15-5, 3.00 ERA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marco Estrada&lt;/strong&gt;: Personally, signing Marco Estrada to a $28M, 2 year deal is my favorite deal of the offseason made by Shapiro-Atkins. Marco had a breakout seasons last year despite starting the year in the bullpen, but he was also very consistent in the Brewers organization (his ERA never went over 4.4 in his 4 seasons with the Beermakers). However, Estrada is a pretty extreme flyball pitcher, with an average flyball rate (FB/BIP) of 47.6% in his career. Given that Rogers Centre is fairly hitter-friendly, he needs to keep his pitchers down in the zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prediction: 14-7, 3.15 ERA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R.A. Dickey&lt;/strong&gt;: Dickey really is an unpredictable pitcher, because of his reliance on his knuckleball. I would say he has been mediocre since he came over from the Mets (he has a .494 winning percentage and an elevated FIP with the Jays). This is his age 41 season, but he’s a true workhorse, pitching more than 200 innings for the past 5 seasons. I can see him as a solid mid-rotation pitcher, though he really needs to suppress his walk rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prediction: 9-10, 4.00 ERA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J.A. Happ&lt;/strong&gt;: I am a bit skeptical about Happ. He left as a free agent in 2014, and he seemed shaky at best during his previous tenure with the Jays (elevated ERA, K/9 below average at 7.5). Though he did perform exceptionally well in Pittsburgh and Seattle, I doubt he can replicate his success here, although as the only southpaw in the Jays rotation, he might see more actions than, say, Gavin Floyd and Drew Hutchison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prediction: 9-12, 4.50 ERA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aaron Sanchez&lt;/strong&gt;: Sanchez is a very promising pitcher with great stuff. We saw in the last 2 seasons that he is an effective reliever. In my opinion, he needs to work on his control and command more. His BB/9 last season was 4.3 and K/9 5.9, which is clearly not desirable for a starting pitcher. If he can fix his commmand issues, then he would be a solid piece in the Jays pitching staff. Still, if I were John Gibbons, I would put Sanchez in the bullpen, because 1. Sanchez is only 23 and 2. Jays bullpen is in shambles after the departures of Lowe and Hawkins and the injury of Loup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prediction: 8-8, 4.00 ERA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bullpen&quot;&gt;Bullpen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bullpen is mediocre at best. Roberto Osuna and Brett Cecil are the only reliable pitchers that Gibbons actually trusts. But even Osuna, despite his great success as the closer last season (K/BB at 4.69 and 2.58 ERA), has the tendency to give up homeruns in tight situations. He’s only 21 after all for goodness’ sake, but he needs to keep the balls low in the zone and control his flyball ratio (currently above 40%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brett Cecil, the only lefty in the ‘pen, is also under immense pressure. His scoreless streak is still intact, and his impressive 5.38 K/BB ratio makes him one of the most elite relievers in all of baseball. He should be used exclusively in high leverage situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know much about Drew Storen, although to be honest, trading Revere for Storen was a wise move (trading an area of strength for an area of weakness). Making Storen the setup man would be ideal, if he could put up his 29-save performance from last season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Chavez and Gavin Floyd are both former starters, which means they don’t have too much experience in the bullpen. Chavez should be used in low-leverage situations or even as a mop-up man, while Floyd might perform well enough to warrant several spot starts in the rotation in case the starters get a bit overworked.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><strong>Psychology = Study of the behaviour and the mind</strong><br />
Behaviour = actions and responses
Mind = internal states and processes, such as thoughts and feelings</p>

<p>Psychology is a science. It is a systematic gathering and evaluating of empirical evidence.</p>

<p>Subfields: Biopsychology, developmental, experimental, industrial-organizational, personality, social etc.</p>

<p><strong>4 Central Goals of Psychology</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe how people and animals behave</li>
  <li>Explain and understand causes of these behaviours</li>
  <li>Predict behaviours under certain conditions</li>
  <li>Influence/Control behaviours through knowledge and control of its causes to enhance human welfare</li>
</ol>

<p>Psychology can be made up of different perspectives.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="the-structuralism-perspective">The Structuralism Perspective</h1>

<p>Wilhelm Wundt -&gt; First psychology lab with Titchener -&gt; Founded the <strong>Structuralism</strong> approach</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mind -&gt; studied by breaking it into basic components</li>
  <li>Used “introspection” to study sensations</li>
  <li>Gave way to <strong>functionalism</strong> (functions of consciousness)</li>
  <li>“Describe inner experiences”</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="the-functionalism-perspective">The Functionalism Perspective</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Our hands -&gt; “Why do we have hands”</li>
  <li>Ask similar questions about mental processes and behaviours</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="the-psychodynamic-perspective">The Psychodynamic Perspective</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Searches for causes of behaviours within the inner workings of our personality</li>
  <li>Emphasizes the role of consciousness</li>
  <li><strong>Psychoanalysis</strong> is the analysis of internal and primarily unconscious psychological forces</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="the-behavioural-perspective">The Behavioural Perspective</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Focuses on the role of the external environment in governing our actions</li>
  <li>John Locke -&gt; Tabula Rasa -&gt; Human nature is shaped by our environment</li>
  <li>Notable figures: Pavlov, Thorndike, Watson (Little Albert experiment), Skinner</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="the-humanistic-perspective">The Humanistic Perspective</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Emphasizes free will, personal growth, self-actualization, and the attempt to find meaning in one’s existence</li>
  <li>Rejects psychodynamics</li>
  <li>The <strong>Postive Psychology Movement</strong> -&gt; focusing on strengths and fulfillments</li>
  <li>Notable figures: Maslow (Hierarchy of Needs), Rogers</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="the-cognitive-perspective">The Cognitive Perspective</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Examines nature of mind</li>
  <li>Perceptions are organized so that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”</li>
  <li>How mental processes influence behaviours</li>
  <li>Notable figures: Ebbinghaus -&gt; Gestalt Psychology (1920s)</li>
  <li><strong>Gestalt</strong> = perception and problem solving
    <ul>
      <li>figure-ground</li>
      <li>closure</li>
      <li>proximity</li>
      <li>similarity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="modern-cognitive-psychology">Modern Cognitive Psychology</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Notable figure: Elizabeth Loftus</li>
  <li>The <strong>Misinformation Effect</strong> -&gt; Impacts eyewitness memory and testimony</li>
  <li>Factors can distort memory</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="may-9-2016---lecture-2">May 9, 2016 - Lecture 2</h2>

<h1 id="the-socialcultural-perspective">The Socialcultural Perspective</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Examines how the social environment and culturla learning influence our behaviour, thoughts, and feelings</li>
  <li><strong>Social Psychology Component</strong> - how the presence of other people influence our behaviour, thoughts, and feelings</li>
  <li><strong>Cultural Component</strong> - Enduring values, beliefs, behavious, and traditions that are shared by a large group of people and passed from one generation to the next Ex. Individualism vs. Collectivism</li>
  <li>Asch Experiment - influence the presence of others will have on our decision-making (conformity)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-biological-perspective">The Biological Perspective</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Examines how brain processes and other bodily functions regulate behaviour</li>
  <li><strong>Behavioural Neuroscience</strong> - examines brain processes and other physiological functions that underlie our behaviours, sensory experiences, emotions, and thoughts</li>
  <li>Notable figures: Lashley, Scoville, Milner, Hebb</li>
  <li>Most famous person: patient H.M. (memory loss)
    <ul>
      <li>to alleviate seizures related to epilepsy, had brain surgery</li>
      <li>no more seizures, but caused him to have amnesia (wasn’t able to create new memories)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Another example: Capgras Syndrome</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2---studying-behaviour-scientifically">Chapter 2 - Studying Behaviour Scientifically</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Scientific attitudes</li>
  <li>Scientific process</li>
  <li>Types of variables</li>
  <li>Correlational research</li>
  <li>Experimental research</li>
  <li>Statistics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scientific Attitudes</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Kitty Genovese Murder (1964) - Bystander Apathy</li>
  <li>Darley &amp; Latane: Why would nobody call the police? Was there something more going on here?</li>
  <li>Darley &amp; Latane:
    <ul>
      <li>Rather than apaty, perhaps it was “diffusion of responsibility”</li>
      <li>Created an if-then question</li>
      <li>In an emergency, IF multiple bystanders are present, THEN the likelihood that any one bystander will intervene is reduced</li>
      <li>They designed an experiment to test their hypothesis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Correlational Method</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Study relationships between variables</li>
  <li>Variable: anything that can be measured</li>
  <li>E.g. more smokes, more cancer; higher IQ, more money</li>
  <li>Relationship between variables is shown by a statistic, the <strong>correlation coefficient (r)</strong></li>
  <li>r can be anything between -1.0 and +1.0 (STAT 231 amirite)</li>
  <li>Examples: marijuana and GPA; marijuana and junk food consumption; GPA and height</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Methods of Research</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Correlational Research</li>
  <li>Experimental</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An in-depth analysis of an individual a group, or an event</li>
  <li>Data may be gathered through observation, interviews, psychological tests, task performances, physiological recordings, or archival records</li>
  <li>Examples of key case studies: H.M., Phineas Gage</li>
  <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows for the study of rare phenomenon</li>
      <li>A case study may challenge the validity of a theory or a widely held scientific belief</li>
      <li>Can be a source of new ideas and hypotheses that can be further investigated through controlled experiments</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Not just people, events as well</li>
  <li>Examples: Flashbulb memories (Assassination of JFK, the Challenger Explosion, Death of Diana, 9/11)</li>
  <li>Monumental events that impact a large group of people</li>
  <li><strong>Limitations</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Poor method for determining “cause-effect”</li>
      <li>Case studies may not generalize to other people’s situations</li>
      <li>Observers may not be objective in gathering and interpreting the data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We should be skeptical about case studies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hemispheric lateralization</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Our brains have left and right cerebral hemispheres</li>
  <li>Left brain vs. Right brain</li>
  <li>Lateralization - refers to the relatively greater location of a function in one hemisphere or the other</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="may-27-2016---term-test-1-review">May 27, 2016 - Term Test 1 Review</h2>

<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Psychology = scientific study of behaviour (actions/responses that we can directly observe) and the mind (internal states and processes; must be inferred)</p>

<p><strong>Structuralism</strong>: 1879, Wundt &amp; Titchener: the analysis of the mind in terms of its basic elements; introspection (looking within); sensations = basic elements of consciousness</p>

<p><strong>Functionalism</strong>: psychology should study the functions of consciousness; influenced by evolutionary theory; William James; gave rise to cognitive and evolutionary psychology</p>

<p><strong>Psychodynamic</strong>: searches for causes of behaviour within the inner workings of our personality (our unique pattern of traits, emotions and motives); emphasizes the role of unconscious processes; Sigmund Freud; Psychoanalysis: analysis of internal and primarily unconscious psychological forces; Defense mechanisms: techniques that help us cope with anxiety and pain of traumatic experiences, e.g. repression; dominated early 1900s, continue to exist</p>

<p><strong>Modern Psychodynamic</strong>: object relations theories focus on how early experiences with caregivers shape the views that people form of themselves</p>

<p><strong>Behaviourism</strong>: role of the external environment in governing our actions; emphasizes environmental control of behaviour through learning; rooted in British empiricism; Ivan Pavlov: dog salivation experiment; Edward Thorndike: organisms learn through the consequences of their actions; 1913, John B. Watson: observable behaviour, “human beings are products of their learning experiences”, “give me a dozen infants” quote; B.F. Skinner: “a person does not act upon the world, the world acts upon him”, how behaviour is shaped by rewarding and punishing</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive Behaviourism</strong>: learning experiences and the environment influence our expectations and other thoughts, and in turn our thoughts influence behaviour; influential</p>

<p><strong>Humanism</strong>: free will, personal growth, attempt to find meaning in one’s existence; rejected psychodynamic concepts; rejects unconsciousness; denied behaviourism (humans = reactors molded by environment); Abraham Maslow: inborn force toward self-actualization, reaching of one’s individual potential; importance of personal choice and responsibility, self-worth; meaning of existence resides in our own hands; must take personal responsibility to turn things around; Carl Rogers: humanist, pioneer of psychotherapy; positive psychology movement: human strengths, fulfillment and optimal living</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive Perspective</strong>: nature of the mind and how mental processes influence behaviour; humans = information processors whose actions are governed by thought; structuralism + functionalism; Hermann Ebbinghaus: studied memory; Gestalt (whole/organization) psychology -&gt; examines how elements of experience are organized into wholes (greater than the sum of its parts); Jean Piaget: children’s thinking processes become more sophisticated with age</p>

<p><strong>Modern Cognitive Perspective</strong>: study of mental processes; processes by which people reason and make decisions, devise solutions to problems, form perceptions and mental images; Elizabeth Loftus: memory and how we distort it; Cognitive neuroscience: electrical recording and brain-imaging to examine brain activity during cognitive tasks; Social constructivism: reality is our own mental creation, the product of a shared way of thinking among members of social groups</p>

<p><strong>Sociocultural Perspective</strong>: exami nes how the social environment and cultural learning influence our behaviour, thoughts, and feelings; culture = enduring values, beliefs, behaviours, and traditions that are shared by a large group of people and passed down generationally; norms = rules that specify what behaviour is acceptable and expected for members; cultural psychology: how culture is transmitted to its members and examines psychological similarities and differences; individualism: emphasis on personal goals and self-identity based on one’s own attributes and achievements; collectivism: individual goals are subordinated to those of the group; Asch Experiement: conformity</p>

<p><strong>Biological Perspective</strong>: how brain processes and other bodily functions regulate behaviour; Behavioural neuroscience: brain processes and other physiological functions that underlie our behaviour, sensory experiences, emotions, and thoughts; Karl Lashley, Donald Hebb: brain’s role in leraning, trained rats to run mazes, mapped brain regions involved in specific psychological functions</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Correlational Method</strong>: Study relationships among variables; behaviours, events, characteristics; e.g. more smokes, more cancer; correlation coefficienct (r)</p>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong>: in-depth analysis of an individual, group, or event; data may be gathered through observation, interviews, psychological tests, task performances, physiologicla recordings, or archival records; e.g. H.M., David from the Capgras Delusion video (Capgras = irrational belief that a familiar person or place has been replaced with an exact duplicate), Phineas Gage</p>

<p><strong>Experimental</strong>: experimental group and control group</p>

<p><strong>Naturalistic Observation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Survey Research</strong></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Phineas Gage</strong>: Damaged ventromedial frontal lobe -&gt; change in personality</p>

<p><strong>The Brain</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cerebral Cortex: outermost layer of brain, many connections to other areas
    <ul>
      <li>Frontal: complex cognition, motor cortex</li>
      <li>Temporal: auditory, language</li>
      <li>Occipital: visual</li>
      <li>Parietal: sensory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Neurons:
    <ul>
      <li>Cell body (Soma): contains biochemical structure that keep the neuron alive</li>
      <li>Dendrites: antennae that collect messages from other neurons</li>
      <li>Axon: covered by myelin sheath, conducts electrical impulses away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands</li>
      <li>Synaptic Transmission: synthesis of neurotransmitter -&gt; storage in synaptic vesicles -&gt; release into synaptic space -&gt; binding to receptor sites -&gt; deactivation through reuptake or breakdown</li>
      <li>Broca’s and Wernicke’s Area: Broca’s (expressive) aphasia: trouble speaking fluently but comprehension is preserved; Wernicke’s (fluent) aphasia: unable to understand language in its written or spoken form</li>
      <li>Neural plasticity: ability of neurons to change in structure and function; impacted by genetic factors and environment; greater number of synapses results in quicker and more complete recovery</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Synesthesia: one type of stimulation evokes the sensation of another; possible explanations: cross connections of the senses at the neural level, OR we are all born with it, as brain develops it fades and changes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Olds and Miller (1953) - mistakenly placed an electrode into a rat’s hypothalamus</li>
  <li>Started repeating the previous activity in hopes of receiving the stimulation again</li>
  <li>Found the pleasure centre of the brain = Nucleus Accumbens</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Human Aggression, Criminal Behaviour, and the Frontal Cortex</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Psychopathy: emotional dysfunction and antisocial behaviour; extreme form of antisocial personality disorder</li>
  <li>PCL-R (Psychopathy checklist): shallow affect (superficial emotional responsiveness), callousness and lack of empathy, parasitic lifestyle, poor behavioural controls, and sexual promiscuity</li>
  <li>Train Dilemma</li>
  <li>Face recognition: some believe face recognition is based on dedicated brain mechanisms</li>
  <li>Face-inversion effect: inversion harms the ability to recognize faces much more than it does other objects</li>
  <li>Prosopagnasia = “face blindness” -&gt; gives us first hand knowledge, demonstration that there is a specialized area of the brain that handles these types of processes</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Jim Twins</li>
  <li><strong>Chrmosomes and Genes</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Hippocrates - suggested that semem contains some sort of design for the formation of offspring</li>
      <li>Gregor Mendel - garden peas -&gt; modern genetic theory</li>
      <li>Dominant and recessive genes</li>
      <li>Genetic Influences: genotype = the specific genetic makeup of an individual, phenotype = observable characteristics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-contribution-of-context">The Contribution of Context</h3>

<h3 id="absolute-threshold">Absolute Threshold</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Intensity at which a stimulus can be detected 50% of the time
    <ul>
      <li>Lower the absolute threshold - higher the sensitivity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A key distinction here is that absolute threshold measures the level that we can actually report sensing a stimuli</li>
  <li>We therefore have to consciously be aware of the stimuli to successfully report it</li>
  <li>What about stimuli that is just below our conscious awareness or our absolute threshold?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="subliminal-perception">Subliminal Perception</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A stimulus that is so weak or brief that, although it is received by the senses, it cannot be perceived consciously</li>
  <li>Late 1950’s: James Vicary (PR Exec) arranged to have subliminal messages flashed on a theatre screen during a movie
    <ul>
      <li>Messages said: “Drink Coca-Cola”, “Eat Popcorn”</li>
      <li>Popcorn sales went up by 50%, Coke 18%</li>
      <li>Public were outraged, fear of brainwashing</li>
      <li>National Association of Broadcasters outlawed subliminal messages on American Tv</li>
      <li>PROBLEM: Results under controlled experiments could not be replicated; Hoax to revive his ad agency</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Studies were finding that subliminal messages didn’t really change consumer behaviour</li>
  <li>But research started to focus on more subtle processes, like our attitudes: Can subliminal messages impact our attitudes?</li>
  <li>Krosnick (1992):
    <ul>
      <li>Showed participants 9 slides showing pictures of people</li>
      <li>Half of participants received negative subliminal messages just prior</li>
      <li>Half received positive subliminal messages just prior</li>
      <li>FINDING: Participants expressed somewhat negative attitudes towards negatively “primed” individuals, compared with their positively primed participants</li>
      <li>Stimuli above absolute threshold is better than subliminal messages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="visual-attention">Visual Attention</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Inattentional blindness
    <ul>
      <li>Failure to notice obvious changes in visual scene</li>
      <li>Sometimes termed change blindness</li>
      <li>Simons and Chabris (1999)
        <ul>
          <li>Subjects watched and attached to a video</li>
          <li>Over 1/2 failed to notice bizarre event</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Change blindness</li>

<h3 id="classical-conditioning">Classical Conditioning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Associating one stimulus with another</li>
  <li>Basic form of learning</li>
  <li>Applications:
    <ul>
      <li>Fear</li>
      <li>Overcoming Fear
        <ul>
          <li>Exposure Therapy: Extinction of CR through exposure to CS without presence of UCS</li>
          <li>Systematic Desensitization: Muscular relaxation paired with gradual exposure to fear-inducing stimulus</li>
          <li>Flooding: Exposure to fearful stimulus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h3>

<p>4 important elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Unconditioned Stimulus(UCS)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Stimulus that elicits a reflexive or innate unconditioned response (UCR) without prior learning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Unconditioned Response(UCR)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Reflexive or innate response elicited by the UCS without prior learning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conditioned Stimulus(CS)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>stimulus that through association with the UCS, comes to elicit a conditioned response similar to the original UCR</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conditioned Response(CR)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Response elicited by a conditioned stimulus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: UCR and CR are the same thing, what elicits them is different!</p>

<h3 id="common-conditioning-procedures">Common Conditioning Procedures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Short-delayed conditioning
    <ul>
      <li>Conditioned stimuli (CS) still present when unconditioned stimulus (UCS) present</li>
      <li>Optimal learning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Trace conditioning
    <ul>
      <li>Gap in time separates end of CS and start of UCS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Simultaneous conditioning
    <ul>
      <li>CS and UCS presented at the same time</li>
      <li>Slow learning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="factors-influencing-classical-conditioning">Factors Influencing Classical Conditioning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Number of pairings for the conditioned and the unconditioned stimulus</li>
  <li>The intensity of the unconditioned stimulus</li>
  <li>How reliably the conditioned stimulus predicts the unconditioned stimulus</li>
  <li>The timing (temporal relationship) between the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="higher-order-conditioning">Higher Order Conditioning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Chain of events which has 2 CS stimuli</li>
  <li>Expands influence of classical conditioning on behaviour</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="classical-conditioning-aversion-therapy">Classical Conditioning: Aversion Therapy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Attempts to condition an aversion or repulsion to a stimulus that triggers unwanted behaviour by pairing it with a noxious UCS</li>
  <li>Example: giving alcoholic patients a drug that induces vomiting any time alcohol is consumed</li>
  <li>Aversion therapy has shown mixed results that are often extinguished over time</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="operant-conditioning">Operant Conditioning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Changing the probability that a behaviour occurs</li>
  <li>Learning a new behaviour</li>
  <li>Operant conditioning has 3 types of events.
    <ul>
      <li>A: Antecedents (stimuli present before the behaviour)</li>
      <li>B: Behaviours</li>
      <li>C: Consequences that follow the behaviour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Behaviour has consequences:
    <ul>
      <li>If the consequence is positive, the behaviour is more likely to occur again</li>
      <li>If the outcome is negative, the behaviour is less likely to occur again</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reinforcement: used to increase the likelihood that a behaviour occurs again
    <ul>
      <li>Positive Reinforcement: deliver something good</li>
      <li>Negative Reinforcement: remove something aversive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Punishment: used to decrease the likelihood that a behaviour occurs again
    <ul>
      <li>Positive Punishment: deliver something aversive</li>
      <li>Negative Punishment: remove something positive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="memory-as-information-processing">Memory as Information Processing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The advent of computers gave rise to the metaphorical comparison that the mind is a processing system that encodes, stores, and retrieves information
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding: getting information into the system by translating it into a neural code that your brain processes
        <ul>
          <li>Like what happens when you type on a computer keyboard</li>
          <li>Your keystrokes are translated into an electrical code that the computer can understand</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Storage: retaining information over time
        <ul>
          <li>Once information is in the system it must be filed away and saved for future access</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Retrieval: the ability to pull information out of storage when we want to use it
        <ul>
          <li>With a computer we would give a command like “open file” to retrieve specific information</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="remebering">Remebering</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Involves all 3 of these processes (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval)</li>
  <li>Failure in any one of these processes can result in memory failure</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-three-component-model">A Three-Component Model</h3>

<ul>
  <li>3 levels of memory:
    <ul>
      <li>Sensory memory: holds information coming through the sense for a period of about a fraction of a second to several seconds; holds the incoming information just long enough for it to the recognized</li>
      <li>Short-term/Working memory: holds information we are conscious of at any given time; aka “working memory” as it consiously processes, codes, and “works on” information we are focusing on; in order to transfer the information from sensory to short-term memory it must be represented in a code; memory codes are mental representations of information
        <ul>
          <li>Rehearsal: purposely repeating information to maintain it in short-term memory or to transfer it to long-term memory</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Long-term memory:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

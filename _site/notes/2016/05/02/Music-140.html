<h3 id="what-is-popular-music">What is Popular Music?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Dependent on the development of
    <ol>
      <li>Different from “folk” and “art” music genres</li>
      <li>The Industrial Revolution changes the system of barter economy to a system of monetary currency (also contributed to 3, the Middle Class, and 4, the growth of urban populations)</li>
      <li>The Emergence of the Middle Class, who possesses <strong>disposable income</strong></li>
      <li>Large Urban Populations (as a result of the rural-to-urban shift)</li>
      <li>Copyright Law -&gt; music itself is an <strong>idea</strong> (Law originated from Queen Mary, who also started stationary companies; musicians have to register and sell royalty)</li>
      <li>Technologies of mass production and broadcasting -&gt; records</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>By 1945:
    <ol>
      <li>End of the “Big Band” era</li>
      <li>Big Band had dominated the music industry since the mid 30s</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>Significant figures: Boney Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey</li>
      <li>
        <p>Returning to focus on vocalist</p>
      </li>
      <li>The music industry divided into 3 distinct categories:
        <ol>
          <li>Popular(Pop): White/Middle Class/Urban</li>
          <li>Race: Black, regardless of class or location</li>
          <li>Hillbilly: Origins in poor, white, rural -&gt; now migrating to urban areas (particular in Southern US) -&gt; Country</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Products of the music industry were sheet music and recordings</li>
      <li>Sheet music dominated recordings until the the late 1920s</li>
      <li>While sheet music was still important, by the end of WWII, the recording industry had come to dominated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Development of the American Music Industry
    <ul>
      <li>What creates the conditions for popular music to become a consumer product?
        <ul>
          <li>1790s to 1830s - Amendments to the copyright law to cover sheet music</li>
          <li>The Victorian Ballad: <strong>Minstrel Shows</strong> and <strong>Parlour Music</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Minstrel Shows
        <ul>
          <li>Variety show that depicted African-Americans in a racist and stereotypical light</li>
          <li>Instruments: Guitar, Banjo, Fiddle, also Piano</li>
          <li>Most important composer: Steven Foster</li>
          <li>Example: “Massa’s in de cold cold ground” (1852)</li>
          <li>Characteristics: guitar accomaniment and vocal control</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Parlour Music
        <ul>
          <li>Industrial Revolution
            <ul>
              <li>Rise of the Middle Class</li>
              <li>Luxury item = Piano = symbol of wealth</li>
              <li>Daughters pursue “leisure” activities</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Example: “Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms” (Early 1800s) by Thomas Moore</li>
          <li>Parlous Song - AABA form in terms of melody</li>
          <li>Characteristics: Piano accomaniment, vocal control, and with themes such as loyalty, honesty, control, and restraint</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Demand for newly composed songs leads to the increased organization of the music industry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Tin Pan Alley
    <ul>
      <li>Charles K. Harris - “After the Ball” (1892): Sheet music sold over 5M copies = “The First Hit Song” -&gt; Why? Urbanization and population growth</li>
      <li>The success of “After the Ball” gave birth to Tin Pan Alley (TPA)</li>
      <li>Both a musical style and a place</li>
      <li>Manhattan in NYC, became the centre of professional music making</li>
      <li>During the 20s and 30s, 21k publisher and 36k composers in a few blocks in TPA</li>
      <li>Division of labour: composers, lyricists, publishers, publicity(marketing), and performers</li>
      <li>Sheet music dominated (though transitioning to recording in the 20s)</li>

<p><strong>Lyrics</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic rhyme scheme</li>
  <li>Syllabic</li>
  <li>Idealized romance - Beginning and Ending</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="african-american-music">African American Music</h2>

<p>Where black culture emerges from and how characteristics map onto emerging culture after slavery ends</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not get rock’n roll without the slave trade</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>North American Slave Trade (1619-1863)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>1619, First African slaves sold in North America</li>
  <li>Sahara essentially divides Africa into two:
    <ol>
      <li>Northern Africa - more associated with Middle East</li>
      <li>South Sub-Saharan Africa</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Majority of North American slaves came from South Sub-Saharan West Africa</li>
  <li>Despite salvers’ attempts to extinguish slav culture, some aspects such as music, survived, in fact music was omnipresent</li>
  <li>Where Rock ‘n Roll began</li>
  <li>Work songs:
    <ul>
      <li>Used to pass time, set pace, or coordinate group work for efficiency (i.e. synchronize axe swings)</li>
      <li>Help saving lives: by slowing pace, work songs made the group seem at the same pace, making it hard for owners to distinguish sick/slackers</li>
      <li>“Floating pool of verse”: floating verse created by song leader - majority were men, highly valued; had many fragmented verses, made songs up on the spot</li>
      <li>E.g. “Old Alabama” (1947): Slavery ended 12 years before recording technology, therefore we are not listening to slaves but rather a prison gang; this recording is by prisoners in 1947; song leader initiates and everyone joins in; not just a song, more like a game to keep spirits up - had to discern verse from syllables of song leader</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="folk-music">Folk Music</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Performed by amateurs (derived from the French word for lovers, amore; means “doing it for free”, not paid)</li>
  <li>For self or community entertainment</li>
  <li>Oral tradition - passed down generationally via experience</li>
  <li>More concern with tradition than innovation (lacking “self-consciousness”)
    <ul>
      <li>Not professionalization - quest for innovation, to stand out to get noticed; folk culture contrasts this, it focuses on continuity of tradition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>African Retentions:
    <ul>
      <li>Interest in percussion and distorted timbres
        <ul>
          <li>Timbre(tamber) (physical/audible): quality of an instrument that allows identification</li>
          <li>West African culture has a focus on percussion (drums, but anything that is struck)</li>
          <li>Distortion: unintended alteration of your signal - West African Perspective: seen as an overflow of intensity/investment of energy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Value in the Ecstatic and the Cathartic: Sweat means energy</li>
      <li>Rhythmic complexity - syncopation
        <ul>
          <li>Indian music has complex notes and rhythms - no chords or harmonies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use of “riffs”, a small, self-contained, music gesture that is repeated over and over, becomes the basis of a longer composition (opposite: motif)</li>
      <li>Use of “call and response” -&gt; West African perspective: no difference between performer and audience. Audience sing and dance with performer (in contrast to Western concert); E.g. YouTube video “Pop Song”, Jon Lajoie</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>American Civil War (1861-1865) and Post-Slavery (1865-)
    <ul>
      <li>Institutionalized racism</li>
      <li>Acceleration of rural-to-urban shift</li>
      <li>New forms of music appear during late 1800s:
        <ol>
          <li>Ragtime(“The Entertainer”) - urban</li>
          <li>Jazz - urban</li>
          <li>Blues, Country (rural) Blues:
            <ul>
              <li>Wandering musicians</li>
              <li>Male vocalist, with acoustic guitar</li>
              <li>Plaintive vocal sound - lament</li>
              <li>Themes: travel, economy, and love</li>
              <li>12 Measure phrases (known as bars)</li>
              <li>a-a-b lyric pattern</li>
              <li>Call and response between guitar and voice</li>
              <li>Floating pool of verse</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Robert Johnson (1911-1938)
    <ul>
      <li>Defined standards for blues guitar</li>
      <li>Peak: November 1936 and June 1937 - The Complete Recordings</li>
      <li>Mythic character</li>
      <li>E.g. “Sweet Home Chicago”, November 1936: added six/Boogie-woogie pattern (note: take a body of the song and put it into intro and outro (end of each verse is similar to intro))</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Word of the Class: Self-Conscious (indicator of  professional performer; unlike folk performer; Actively thinking about how to innovate and improve in order to gain more audience)</p>

<p><strong>Changes in Technology</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mechanical Reproduction
    <ul>
      <li>1877: Edison invented phonograph (gave rise to gramophone)</li>
      <li>1892-1912: Transition from cylinders to disks</li>
      <li>1925: Industry standard speed set to 78 RPM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What was recorded?
    <ul>
      <li>Sheet music/TPA(Tin Pan Alley)</li>
      <li>Black music/rural Southern white music not recorded because:
        <ul>
          <li>cultural chauvinism (people who control the technology did not think other cultures were worth recording)</li>
          <li>Rural areas - less sales</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Commercial Radio, 1920
    <ul>
      <li>January 1922 - 28 stations -&gt; December 1922 - 570 stations</li>
      <li>Controlled by only a few networks (CBS, NBC, Mutual)</li>
      <li>First radio network: NBC, 1928</li>
      <li>Very few independent radio stations existed</li>
      <li>Network radio began to change patterns of consumption form regional to national</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rise-of-the-record-industry">The Rise of the Record Industry</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The record industry concerned - needs to find new markets</li>
  <li>Ralph Peer - worked for Okeh Records</li>
  <li>Finding songs (repertoire) and artists (A&amp;R guy - artists and repertoire)</li>
  <li>1920 - “Crazy Blues” - Mamie Smith
    <ul>
      <li>due to institutionalizedracism - black people did not record music</li>
      <li>first significant recording by AA artists despite origin in 1877</li>
      <li>song was a minor hit - purchased by white people despite racism</li>
      <li>black community did not have a lot of purchasing power, thus they were not a targeted market</li>
      <li>not a Blues song, much more associated to Jazz. Jazz is closely linked to popular music up to post-war</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Market research in popular music
    <ul>
      <li>most radio music is TPA</li>
      <li>Ignored black cultural and southern rural white culture, thought culture was artistically and economically insignificant</li>
      <li>Peer decided to used records to play what radio did not</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Introduction of “Hillbilly”: Carve that Possum - Uncle Dave Macon, 1927
    <ul>
      <li>Uncle Dave Macon and the Fruit Jar Drinkers</li>
      <li>Early origin of country (music of Southeastern states, now called blue bratz) and western</li>
      <li>More energy/intensity, very hard, on beat</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>The Crew Cuts: July 1954/Mercury Records (AABA,Sh-Boom(A), Sh-Boom(A),BA, still retained the AABA structure; deliberately repeated the AABA pattern to appeal to white middle class audiences, will sound more familiar; Changes:)</li>
  <li>The Chords: Form: 1x through AABA, with interludes; Voice: distorted - use of lower octave in B; Solo: Sax - distorted timbre, sexual metaphor</li>
  <li>The Crew Cuts: Form: 2x through AABA - clearly stated; Voice: Clean, no use of lower octave; Solo: No solo - repeats of “Sh-boom” group vocal - timpani joke (cartoon reference)</li>

  <li>The Crew Cuts: no R&amp;B / #1 Pop for 9 weeks - Song of the Year (not The Chords)</li>
  <li>Both white and black artists performing in this new style: a mix of pop, C&amp;W, and R&amp;B, targeted teenagers - Rock ‘n Roll (term attributed to Alan Freed; term goes at least back to the 1800s out of Black culture)</li>

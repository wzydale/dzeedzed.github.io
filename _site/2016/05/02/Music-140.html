  <li>Tin Pan Alley
    <ul>
      <li>Charles K. Harris - “After the Ball” (1892): Sheet music sold over 5M copies = “The First Hit Song” -&gt; Why? Urbanization and population growth</li>
      <li>The success of “After the Ball” gave birth to Tin Pan Alley (TPA)</li>
      <li>Both a musical style and a place</li>

  <li>Syllabic</li>
  <li>Idealized romance - Beginning and Ending</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="african-american-music">African American Music</h2>

<p>Where black culture emerges from and how characteristics map onto emerging culture after slavery ends</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not get rock’n roll without the slave trade</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>North American Slave Trade (1619-1863)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>1619, First African slaves sold in North America</li>
  <li>Sahara essentially divides Africa into two:
    <ol>
      <li>Northern Africa - more associated with Middle East</li>
      <li>South Sub-Saharan Africa</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Majority of North American slaves came from South Sub-Saharan West Africa</li>
  <li>Despite salvers’ attempts to extinguish slav culture, some aspects such as music, survived, in fact music was omnipresent</li>
  <li>Where Rock ‘n Roll began</li>
  <li>Work songs:
    <ul>
      <li>Used to pass time, set pace, or coordinate group work for efficiency (i.e. synchronize axe swings)</li>
      <li>Help saving lives: by slowing pace, work songs made the group seem at the same pace, making it hard for owners to distinguish sick/slackers</li>
      <li>“Floating pool of verse”: floating verse created by song leader - majority were men, highly valued; had many fragmented verses, made songs up on the spot</li>
      <li>E.g. “Old Alabama” (1947): Slavery ended 12 years before recording technology, therefore we are not listening to slaves but rather a prison gang; this recording is by prisoners in 1947; song leader initiates and everyone joins in; not just a song, more like a game to keep spirits up - had to discern verse from syllables of song leader</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="folk-music">Folk Music</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Performed by amateurs (derived from the French word for lovers, amore; means “doing it for free”, not paid)</li>
  <li>For self or community entertainment</li>
  <li>Oral tradition - passed down generationally via experience</li>
  <li>More concern with tradition than innovation (lacking “self-consciousness”)
    <ul>
      <li>Not professionalization - quest for innovation, to stand out to get noticed; folk culture contrasts this, it focuses on continuity of tradition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>African Retentions:
    <ul>
      <li>Interest in percussion and distorted timbres
        <ul>
          <li>Timbre(tamber) (physical/audible): quality of an instrument that allows identification</li>
          <li>West African culture has a focus on percussion (drums, but anything that is struck)</li>
          <li>Distortion: unintended alteration of your signal - West African Perspective: seen as an overflow of intensity/investment of energy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Value in the Ecstatic and the Cathartic: Sweat means energy</li>
      <li>Rhythmic complexity - syncopation
        <ul>
          <li>Indian music has complex notes and rhythms - no chords or harmonies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use of “riffs”, a small, self-contained, music gesture that is repeated over and over, becomes the basis of a longer composition (opposite: motif)</li>
      <li>Use of “call and response” -&gt; West African perspective: no difference between performer and audience. Audience sing and dance with performer (in contrast to Western concert); E.g. YouTube video “Pop Song”, Jon Lajoie</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>American Civil War (1861-1865) and Post-Slavery (1865-)
    <ul>
      <li>Institutionalized racism</li>
      <li>Acceleration of rural-to-urban shift</li>
      <li>New forms of music appear during late 1800s:
        <ol>
          <li>Ragtime(“The Entertainer”) - urban</li>
          <li>Jazz - urban</li>
          <li>Blues, Country (rural) Blues:
            <ul>
              <li>Wandering musicians</li>
              <li>Male vocalist, with acoustic guitar</li>
              <li>Plaintive vocal sound - lament</li>
              <li>Themes: travel, economy, and love</li>
              <li>12 Measure phrases (known as bars)</li>
              <li>a-a-b lyric pattern</li>
              <li>Call and response between guitar and voice</li>
              <li>Floating pool of verse</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Robert Johnson (1911-1938)
    <ul>
      <li>Defined standards for blues guitar</li>
      <li>Peak: November 1936 and June 1937 - The Complete Recordings</li>
      <li>Mythic character</li>
      <li>E.g. “Sweet Home Chicago”, November 1936: added six/Boogie-woogie pattern (note: take a body of the song and put it into intro and outro (end of each verse is similar to intro))</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Word of the Class: Self-Conscious (indicator of  professional performer; unlike folk performer; Actively thinking about how to innovate and improve in order to gain more audience)</p>

<p><strong>Changes in Technology</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mechanical Reproduction
    <ul>
      <li>1877: Edison invented phonograph (gave rise to gramophone)</li>
      <li>1892-1912: Transition from cylinders to disks</li>
      <li>1925: Industry standard speed set to 78 RPM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What was recorded?
    <ul>
      <li>Sheet music/TPA(Tin Pan Alley)</li>
      <li>Black music/rural Southern white music not recorded because:
        <ul>
          <li>cultural chauvinism (people who control the technology did not think other cultures were worth recording)</li>
          <li>Rural areas - less sales</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Commercial Radio, 1920
    <ul>
      <li>January 1922 - 28 stations -&gt; December 1922 - 570 stations</li>
      <li>Controlled by only a few networks (CBS, NBC, Mutual)</li>
      <li>First radio network: NBC, 1928</li>
      <li>Very few independent radio stations existed</li>
      <li>Network radio began to change patterns of consumption form regional to national</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rise-of-the-record-industry">The Rise of the Record Industry</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The record industry concerned - needs to find new markets</li>
  <li>Ralph Peer - worked for Okeh Records</li>
  <li>Finding songs (repertoire) and artists (A&amp;R guy - artists and repertoire)</li>
  <li>1920 - “Crazy Blues” - Mamie Smith
    <ul>
      <li>due to institutionalizedracism - black people did not record music</li>
      <li>first significant recording by AA artists despite origin in 1877</li>
      <li>song was a minor hit - purchased by white people despite racism</li>
      <li>black community did not have a lot of purchasing power, thus they were not a targeted market</li>
      <li>not a Blues song, much more associated to Jazz. Jazz is closely linked to popular music up to post-war</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Market research in popular music
    <ul>
      <li>most radio music is TPA</li>
      <li>Ignored black cultural and southern rural white culture, thought culture was artistically and economically insignificant</li>
      <li>Peer decided to used records to play what radio did not</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Introduction of “Hillbilly”: Carve that Possum - Uncle Dave Macon, 1927
    <ul>
      <li>Uncle Dave Macon and the Fruit Jar Drinkers</li>
      <li>Early origin of country (music of Southeastern states, now called blue bratz) and western</li>
      <li>More energy/intensity, very hard, on beat</li>
    </ul>

      <li>clear enunciation, sung very clearly</li>
      <li>groove is “straight” 8ths</li>
      <li>country guitar sound, as opposed to muddy/messy guitar sound</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

      <li>Blues chord structure</li>
      <li>Added 6th (Boogie-woogie)</li>

<h2 id="the-quarrymen-later-known-as-the-beatles">The Quarrymen (later known as The Beatles)</h2>

<p><strong>Early History</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>July 1957, “The Quarrymen” - John Lennon / Paul McCartney (vocals and guitar) began to write songs together (important: they both wrote songs). John invites Paul to join and write songs</li>
  <li>However, neither of them could play guitar solos; needed a lead guitarist</li>
  <li>February 1958 - George Harrison (“Lead” guitarist)</li>
  <li>January 1960 - Stu Sutcliffe (Bass) was added, but he really just stood there because he couldn’t play bass</li>
  <li>The Quarrymen spent a lot of time in Germany playing for American soldiers</li>
  <li>They had their <strong>Rocker</strong> image (black leather jackets, jeans, boots, greased hair) during this time; in Hamburg, Germany
    <ul>
      <li>The British interpretation of American motorcycle gangs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>August 1960 - Changed name to “The Beatles”, added drummer Pete Best
    <ul>
      <li>Became a very busy band, where in England they were busy backing up other singers, and in Germany playing for American soldiers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Liverpool - The Cavern Club</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The Beatles were developing their home club while playing at this night club</li>
  <li>July 1961 - Stu Sutcliffe leaft band to become an artist; Died of brain hemorrhage in April 1962; Paul McCartney switched to bass</li>
  <li>The Beatles were very rough - they got into a lot of fights, took drugs, spat on audience etc.</li>
  <li>More importantly, they met Brian Epstein, their manager</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brian Epstein</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>December 1961 - Epstein became The Beatles’ manager</li>
  <li>Up to this time, The Beatles were making a lot of recording as back-up artists</li>
  <li>In 1961 they were background music for Tony Sheriton, which became a small hit
    <ul>
      <li>It was Tony’s hit everywhere else, but in Liverpool, residents knew that The Beatles were the ones in the background</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First, Epstein changed The Beatles’ image: more clean-cut
    <ul>
      <li>He made them into men that fathers would be okay if their daughters dated them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next, he got them a record label
    <ul>
      <li>June 1962 - Parlophone (a division of EMI), after being rejected by the major ones (such as DECA)</li>
      <li>EMI didn’t know what to do with them, so they shoved them aside and gave them a producer, George Martin</li>
      <li>Martin didn’t think they were the best, fired Pete Best and hired Ringo Starr</li>
      <li>He would later have a lot of interactions with Paul McCartney as the Beatles began to divide into the John side and the Paul side</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2 id="the-beatles-history-continued">The Beatles: History (Continued)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Love Me Do</strong>, September 1962 (Ringo didn’t play on this record)</li>
  <li>By the end of 1963, The Beatles were one of the most popular acts in Britain
    <ul>
      <li>They performed at the Royal Variety Show in November 1963 at London Palladium</li>
      <li>26 million people viewed this performance</li>
      <li>Sponsored by the Royal Family; Established them as major stars</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Please Please Me</strong>, January 1963 (Ringo as drummer)
    <ul>
      <li>AABA form</li>
      <li>McCartney and Lennon, by this point, were experienced and mature songwriters</li>
      <li>Numerous rehearsed details, change in rhythmic density in vocal</li>
      <li>Highest note at the end of the B section - moment of greatest tension</li>
      <li>TPA-style attention to arrangement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Initially, British musical acts did not do well in the US</li>
  <li>February 1964 - “The Beatles are coming” media campaign in the US
    <ul>
      <li>Referred to as “The New British Invasion” (in reference to the War of Independence)</li>
      <li>Television performance: <strong>Ed Sullivan Show</strong>, February 9, 1964
        <ul>
          <li>70 million viewers; Bruce Springsteen was impressed and inspired, amongst other future rockstars</li>
          <li>The most influential TV appearance ever</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The Beatles invented Arena Gigs - They did a concert at a sports arena (Washington Coliseum), and no band had ever played in such a big venue before</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The American tour lasted for two weeks. They sold over 2 million albums, and $2.5 million worth of merchandise</li>
  <li>When The Beatles returned to England, 50,000 fans were awaiting their arrival at the airport. This hysteria is known as <strong>“Beatlemania”</strong></li>
  <li>In April 1964, 12 Beatles songs in the Billboard Top 100 Pop including spots 1-5, for three weeks</li>
  <li><strong>A Hard Day’s Night</strong> (film), July 1964
    <ul>
      <li>First film; Usually pop star films were bad, but this one was good and funny</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In 1965, by the end of their 4th US tour, they had made $65 million, also played in Shea Stadium in New York
    <ul>
      <li>This craze can be explained by the fact that you have probably seen them at most twice - no videos, only the Ed Sullivan Show and only photographs; Very limited access to seeing artists</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Beatles have <strong>brought back the Golden Age of Rock n Roll</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Not much musically, but the sensibility and more importantly, self-contained bands</li>
      <li>They brought back the approach of the Golden Age, writing and playing own songs and instruments, and playing music primarily based on the electric guitar (all of which disappeared during the in-between years)</li>
      <li>The Beatles formed the template for what is to follow - guitar-based, self-contained, writing/performing own songs</li>
      <li>They were essentially role models for <strong>Mersey Beat</strong>: Gerry and the Pacemakers, The Searchers, The Swinging Blue Jeans with regards to their music and appearance
        <ul>
          <li>Mersey Beat is the sound that is similar to The Beatles</li>
          <li>Liverpool was built on a port - important, because this was where you could get music from sailors</li>
          <li>Mersey Beat was a music publication in Liverpool; it carried news about all the local Liverpool bands</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Help</strong> (film), July 1965
    <ul>
      <li>The Beatles’ second film</li>
      <li>Very influential - American TV created a band (“The Monkees”) modelled on the look from the movie</li>
      <li>The TV show was about an imaginary band that wanted to be The Beatles, but was never successful</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Yesterday</strong>, 1965 (from Help)
    <ul>
      <li>AABA form</li>
      <li>More complex harmonic and lyric structure</li>
      <li>Was written almost entirely by Paul McCartney, but none of the other members liked the song; It was not a Beatles tune
        <ul>
          <li>First time a Beatle song where only one Beatle playing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>String quartet also playing
        <ul>
          <li>Shows the growing bond between George Martin and Paul McCartney</li>
          <li>String quartet = composers do their greatest and most serious work</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This song was the first song that something was changing within The Beatles
        <ul>
          <li>Prior to this song, they had met Bob Dylan, who introduced them to drugs, influenced their approach to music - told them that they had good music but their lyrics lacked meaning</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This is the moment when The Beatles stopped being one band and started moving away from each other, between Lennon and McCartney</li>
      <li>The Beatles were evolving - they started to move away from pop song writing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rubber Soul</strong> (album), December 1965
    <ul>
      <li>The Beatles’ first release not to feature their name on the cover, uncommon in 1965</li>
      <li>The Beatles were moving away from singles, and into the realm of albums, and all of the aspects that come with it</li>
      <li>They slowly drifted away from conventional album covers to covers with less words = “Rubber Soul” with a distorted image</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Revolver</strong> (album), August 1966
    <ul>
      <li>By this time, The Beatles were heavily influenced by non-Western culture</li>
      <li>They were interested in studio recording and writing music that could not be played in real life; Very abstract</li>
      <li>Writing and recording is now more important than playing live</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Tomorrow Never Knows</strong>, from the album <strong>Revolver</strong>, August 1966
    <ul>
      <li>Composed by John Lennon</li>
      <li>Song was based on a drone, a note or chord continuously sounded throughout most or all of a piece (influence of non-Western culture)</li>
      <li>Lyrics were based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead</li>
      <li>Vocal was “double-tracked” (John sang the song once and recorded it, then sang it a second time and tried to match it exactly to the first time) - you can’t perfectly match them, there will be always be some kind of discrepency and is run through a Leslie speaker cabinet</li>
      <li>Made use of tape loops (avant garde) and backwards recording</li>
      <li>First known use of <strong>flanging</strong> (audio effect produced by mixing two identical signals together, one delayed by a small and gradually changing period; produces a “Darth Vader effect”)</li>
      <li>Had an Indian musical influence</li>
      <li>The importance of this song: demonstrated the growing influence of non-Western culture and recording studio techonology on the work of The Beatles
        <ul>
          <li>First song that they could not play live</li>
          <li>Creating the studio has become more important to them than being able to play in concerts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Summer 1966, The Beatles were not a good band
    <ul>
      <li>June 1966, Japan - They played awfully, not together as a band</li>
      <li>July 1966, The Phillippines - They were even more exhausted and sounded even worse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>March 1966, Lennon did an interview with an English newspaper, London Evening Standard
    <ul>
      <li>He emerged as the intellectual in the group</li>
      <li>When asked about the conflict between modern pop culture and religious traidtions, Lennon (who was fairly spiritual) said modern religion is more about power, rather than faith, and said people would rather see The Beatles than go to church</li>
      <li>“Bigger than Jesus”</li>
      <li>No reaction from he public until August 1966, when a US teen magazine quoted Lennon’s comments -&gt; extensive protests</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>August 29, 1966 - The Beatles’ final live performance in Candlestick Park in San Francisco
    <ul>
      <li>Final unannounced live performance was on the roof the Apple building in London in January 1969</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Beatles were only in the public light for about 2 years</li>
  <li><strong>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</strong> (album), June 1967
    <ul>
      <li>Considered one of the most important albums in the history of Western pop music</li>
      <li>27 weeks at the top of the albums chart in UK, 15 in US</li>
      <li>The first concept album -&gt; most or all songs were linked to theme: The Beatles wanted to present themselves as someone else (Sgt. Pepper’s Club) and talk about childhood, but both ideas were dumped</li>
      <li>This was an album, not a collection of songs</li>
      <li>The first significant album to include all of the lyrics; The lyrics were printed in full on the back cover</li>
      <li>It was an experience; Listening to the songs in order is very important</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Beatles were changing what popular music was, where you focus on album and musicians not thinking of themselves as entertainers, but instead as artists</li>
  <li>The Beatles’ second great contribution: transforming Rock n Roll into Rock -&gt; music that was more serious and focused</li>

<ul>
  <li>During this Blues revival, The Rolling Stones were put together by Brian Jones to play the music he loved (American Rhythms and Blues)</li>
  <li>July 1962 - First gig at <strong>Marquee Club</strong></li>
  <li>April 1963 - <strong>Andrew Loog Oldham</strong> became The Rolling Stone’s manager
    <ul>
      <li>He created the band’s “Bad Boy” image (anti-Beatles): rude, short-tempered attitude</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1963-1964 - Band started to record singles (American R&amp;B)
    <ul>
      <li>all singles were initially covers of Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, and Willie Dixon</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>I Wanna Be Your Man</strong>, November 1963 (written by Lennon/McCartney)
    <ul>
      <li>The Rolling Stones were signed to DECA Records through the help of The Beatles</li>
      <li>Oldham called Lennon and McCartney to come show them how to write songs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>England’s Newest Hit Makers</strong>, May 1964
    <ul>
      <li>Mostly Blues covers</li>
      <li>Brian Jones was the leader</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>King Bee</strong>, April 1964
    <ul>
      <li>Blues form</li>
      <li>Cover of song by Slim Harpo (1957)</li>
      <li>What’s remarkable:
        <ul>
          <li>Played by white teenagers from England, but the quality of the performance was very similar to the original track</li>
          <li>Jagger’s vocal performace - Where is his accent?
            <ul>
              <li>He nailed the American accent</li>
              <li>One of the keys to the British Blues Revival; They weren’t just fans of Blues, they studied it; level of authenticity they captured is a testament</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Adult relationships in the lyrics</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction</strong>, February 1965 (written by Jagger/Richards)
    <ul>
      <li>See textbook for listening guide</li>
      <li>First US Number One pop</li>
      <li>Different visual experience from The Beatles</li>
      <li>Mick Jagger has a dangerous/darker edge to him. Jagger doesn’t hold any instrument on the stage, unlike The Beatles, so he has a mobile personality on stage and he can move around freely; a mobile, energetic, and intense presentation</li>
      <li>Brian Jones was unhappy with the direction of the band was going in; Was pushed back after the Satisfaction song</li>
      <li>This was when Jagger and Richards became the leaders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Their Music Style</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The Rolling Stones had a very <strong>loose/relaxed sound</strong> - there was improvisation, unlike The Beatles, where each note was thought about and structured for a reason</li>
  <li>The Beatles were rooted in the TPA era, whereas The Rolling Stones were rooted in the Blues</li>
  <li>This is a band that is used to working out songs overtime and allowing them to change over time</li>
  <li>They would roughly work out a song, and go out and start playing it
    <ul>
      <li>The soung would be recognizable every time they played it, but it would be different</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Room for spontaneous changeability in small things</li>
  <li>They were more interested in <strong>capturing the energy of a moment/performance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Process-oriented</strong> (more interested in the journey, rather than the destination)
    <ul>
      <li>Before the Golden Age, African-Americans: Process-oriented; White culture: Object-oriented or product-oriented</li>
      <li>Post-Golden Age: skin colour doesn’t matter as much, bands can choose whatever they want</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Let’s Spend the Night Together</strong>, 1967
    <ul>
      <li>Verse/Chorus</li>
      <li>Brian Jones had been drifting away from the band after Richards and Jagger started to take control; Also becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1969 - The Stone went to a tour for several months in the US
    <ul>
      <li>Brian Jones had visa problems due to his drug charges in the US</li>
      <li>Instead of cancelling the tour, the group went to with the tour without Jones</li>
      <li>Jones announced that he would be leaving the band; he died 5 weeks after in a swimming pool</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-important-bands-of-the-british-blues-revival">Other Important Bands of the British Blues Revival</h2>

<ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Guitar player</li>

              <li>Clapton was unhappy with the direction, like Brian Jones, especially after their first hit, <strong>For Your Love</strong> (1965) (original song was recorded with studio recordings)</li>

            </ul>

              <li>Studio guitarist</li>

              <li>Became lead guitarist within a year</li>
              <li>Disappointed when the band wanted to call it quits in 1968, because he had given up his lucrative studio career for this band</li>
              <li>The band gave Page the tour they had booked in Scandinavia, and Page formed a new band The New Yardbirds. The tour was a tremendous success, and when they came back they changed their name to <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The Who</strong> (The Mods/Art Influence) The Modernists = The Mods
    <ul>
      <li>Also considered parts of the British Blues Revival</li>
      <li>They never had a strong Blues sound</li>
      <li>The first group to create a full song of <strong>Rock Opera</strong> (a work of rock music that presents a storyline told over multiple parts, songs, or sections)
        <ul>
          <li>“Tommy”, 1969</li>
          <li>“Quadrophenia”, 1973</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>At the time (and much of the career) phenomenally loud band
        <ul>
          <li>Played with more volume and aggression than any other band of their era</li>
          <li>Part of it due to the drummer, Keith Moon</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pete Townshend</strong> (songwriter) influenced the direction of the band; He was bringing in things that was ahead of their time
        <ul>
          <li>Drug influences (as early as 1965)</li>
          <li>Political issues</li>
          <li>Addressing the gap between parents and their children, the fact that the new generation was looking athe world in a very different way</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Townshend brought all of them into songs</li>
      <li><strong>My Generation</strong>, 1965
        <ul>
          <li>Had one the first rock bass solos</li>
          <li>About the generational gap</li>
          <li>Provocative lines: “Hope I die before I get old”, this would be prominent in 10 years, when Punk came about</li>
          <li>Introduced <strong>stuttering</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>The Who, while still playing at clubs in London, became very popular with a subculture called <strong>The Mods (The Modernists)</strong></li>
              <li>The Mods were the enemies of the <strong>Rockers</strong> (The Beatles’ first image)</li>
              <li>The Mods were sophisticated, well-dressed, wore sharp suits, Vespa Scooters (defining feature) with lots of mirrors and lights</li>
              <li>The Mods loved dancing and taking amphetamines; the drug usage causes you to start thinking faster than you can speak, and that causes <strong>stuttering</strong> (a sign of amphetamine use), which was what Pete Townshend was referring to</li>
              <li>Everyone in that generation understood the reference</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The Who was also famous for smashing guitars on stage at the end of major gigs
        <ul>
          <li>Why? Pete was experimenting with “what is a performance?” -&gt; The art world in the 1960s was very experimental. Some ideas:
            <ul>
              <li>Real art happens in the moment and real art is something that your experience, and it won’t happen again</li>
              <li>A “happenin’” was an artistic event; art isn’t a picture that hangs on the wall, art is something we live in, and it surrounds us</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Pete Townshend: Instruments are just tools, and what’s important is the experience
            <ul>
              <li>Similar to breaking glasses after a toast: that vow or promise you just toasted to cannot be alterted or taken back</li>
              <li>The concert you just saw will never be seen again, because the instruments that made it possible are now destroyed</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="soul-music">Soul Music</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Development connected to the Civil Rights movement and the development of African-American identity.</li>
  <li>Late 1950s into the early 1960s - growing anticipation of civil rights.</li>
  <li>Rejection of Blues as the sound of the past, rural south, and slavery
    <ul>
      <li>R&amp;B music was too rough, and it didn’t have class anymore that seemed like it was “worked out”. African-Americans were starting to find equality</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pop music within black culture is profoundly linked to the idea of African American identity and the Civil Rights movement
    <ul>
      <li>Soul music is often a reflection of the success and then growing failure of the movement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New sound of the urban - Soul Music</strong></p>

<p>Soul Music is a fusion of 3 elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Vocal style comes from Gospel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Gospel music, and this vocal style were thought be definitively African-American</li>
      <li>Soul music needed to be optimistic and yet also rooted strongly Black Culture; They wanted to look at a brighter/urban future</li>
      <li>So Soul artists turned to Gospel music (Ray Charles in particular) to provide optimistic black music</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rhythm and back beat of R&amp;B</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong back beat, because Soul music is supposed to be meant for dancing and celebrations (hency why the groove is so important)</li>
      <li>They took the beats of R&amp;B and sped them up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Arrangements and lyric styles from TPA</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>More playful, less sexual</li>
      <li>Light pop lyric structure</li>
      <li>Soul music was reflective of the change that was becoming of African-Americans</li>
      <li>Blacks were now urban, lower/middle-class people</li>
      <li>Because of this, they thought they “outgrew” R&amp;B</li>
      <li>So they took from TPA - the instrumental arrangements are what we would associate with TPA</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Founded by Berry Gordy</li>

  <li>First important label owned by an African-American
    <ul>
      <li>Held up as a success story of the Civil Rights movement</li>
      <li>At the time, the most successful company in the US held by an African-American; An example of extrepreneurship of African-Americans</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Starts in 1959 - Based on Gordy’s experience in automotive plants
    <ul>
      <li>Gordy applied assembly line to the music industry and to Black artists</li>
      <li>This had never been done where primarily Black culture was involved (only done for TPA/Major white labels)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Assembly Line - Everything under one roof
    <ul>
      <li>Song writers: Holland/Dozier/Holland, Smokey Robinson</li>
      <li>Maxine Powell: Finishing school (that teaches the musicians how to carry themselves in public), studied how Motown performers performed, how to act, walk, and talk</li>
      <li>Cholly Atkins: Choreographer; Same choreographer -&gt; consistency</li>
      <li>The Funk Brothers: House band</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Result is absolute consistency of product</li>
  <li><strong>You’d Better Shop Around</strong>, 1960 - Smokey and the Miracles
    <ul>
      <li>Polished, restrained presentation - sophistication</li>
      <li>A great example of the visual presentation of a Motown artist: full suits, neatly groomed
        <ul>
          <li>Positioning themselves apart from R&amp;B artists; Motown looked formal and smooth</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Barry Gordy was trying to target white audiences
        <ul>
          <li>Reason why his artists appeared safe, restrained, and controlled</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You don’t see the band
        <ul>
          <li>This has gone through the TPA style of prodiction (Division-Of-Labour)</li>
          <li>The singers probably didn’t write their own songs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The singers were in front and centre</li>
      <li>Smokey was always projecting outwards
        <ul>
          <li>They were singing to the audience</li>
          <li>The audience was always in the constant in the mind of a Motown performer</li>

              </li>
              <li>Dance:

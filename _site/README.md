# dzeedzed.github.io

My personal website, where I blog, create Go tutorials, and showcase my interests and projects.
You can also reach the site at [http://dzed.me](http://dzed.me). I am considering getting a new, cooler domain name. Built with HTML, CSS, and Jekyll. Blog posts and other contents written in Markdown.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a second year Honours Computer Science Co-op student at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. I'm currently working as a software engineering intern at Gemalto NV in Ottawa, Canada. I have a keen interest in web design and software development, and I have participated in several hackathons, including <a href="http://news.communitech.ca/news/communitech/myo-music-app-wins-waterloo-hacks/">WaterlooHacks (won it as a team)</a> and <a href="https://nhacks.io">NHacks</a>. </p>

        <p>I am currently working on several projects to familiarize myself with new technologies. I have already released an Android application, WatScholarship <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dzed.uwscholarshipfinder&hl=en">(on Google Play)</a>, and am currently in the process of refining its user interface and adding advanced features. I am also interested in applications of statistics in computer science, and I am taking several online courses on machine learning and data analysis.</p>

        <p>I do a lot of stuff when I am not coding. I watch and play baseball (3B/LF, R/R, currently batting over .800), and like analyzing player stats using sites like <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com">FanGraphs</a> and <a href="http://www.brooksbaseball.net">Brooks Baseball</a>. I am also an avid fan of association football(aka soccer), and have done extensive research on football tactics by playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager">Football Manager series</a>. On the pitch, I like to play as a box-to-box midfielder (MC), but can also play as a right wide midfielder (MR/WR) or right back (RB).</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> is an important part of my life. I started playing Go at the age of 7, and achieved 5-dan, the highest amateur ranking in Go in 2009. I launched a series of <a href="/gotutorials.html">Go tutorials</a> a while ago, and am still adding new tutorials to it. </p>

        <p>I have a <a href="/dreamlist.html">Dream List</a> where I list all my goals and dreams. </p>

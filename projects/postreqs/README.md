## Postreqs

A web application that helps UWaterloo students check for postreqs/successor courses, given a course code. For example, If you enter "MATH 237",  it will return several STAT courses that require MATH 237 to be taken.

### Wireframes

1. User enters a Course code (three input fields, one for faculty, one for subject, one for numerical code)
2. Verify the corresponding course exists, make request to UW API
3. If it does, get response, parse
4.

So in this tutorial, I will tell you where you can actually play Go and be a part of the Go community. 

You can play online (there are tons of Go clients/platforms, which I will talk about in detail in this tutorial) or join a local or univeristy Go club. Either way, you will get to meet a lot of people who are enthusiastic about Go and improve your Go skills. Personally, I've played at least 1500 Go games online in my life so far. I would say that without these games, I would not be where I am today. Go has taught me a lot, about concentration, perseverance, respect, and humility. If you are really dedicated to Go, it will be a huge time sink, but it's definitely rewarding and satisfying.

If it is possible, it is better for you to start learning Go with actual Go boards (Chinese: 棋盘 qipan; Japanese: 碁盤 goban) and Go stones (Chinese: 棋子 qizi; Japanese: 碁石 goishi, or simply 石 ishi). They just feel better and more intimate. Most North American univeristies have active Go clubs.

**Psychology = Study of the behaviour and the mind**  
Behaviour = actions and responses
Mind = internal states and processes, such as thoughts and feelings

Psychology is a science. It is a systematic gathering and evaluating of empirical evidence.

Subfields: Biopsychology, developmental, experimental, industrial-organizational, personality, social etc.

**4 Central Goals of Psychology**

1. Describe how people and animals behave
2. Explain and understand causes of these behaviours
3. Predict behaviours under certain conditions
4. Influence/Control behaviours through knowledge and control of its causes to enhance human welfare

Psychology can be made up of different perspectives.

<br />

# The Structuralism Perspective #

Wilhelm Wundt -> First psychology lab with Titchener -> Founded the **Structuralism** approach

* Mind -> studied by breaking it into basic components
* Used "introspection" to study sensations
* Gave way to **functionalism** (functions of consciousness)
* "Describe inner experiences"

<br />

# The Functionalism Perspective #

* Our hands -> "Why do we have hands"
* Ask similar questions about mental processes and behaviours

<br />

# The Psychodynamic Perspective #

* Searches for causes of behaviours within the inner workings of our personality
* Emphasizes the role of consciousness
* **Psychoanalysis** is the analysis of internal and primarily unconscious psychological forces

<br />

# The Behavioural Perspective

* Focuses on the role of the external environment in governing our actions
* John Locke -> Tabula Rasa -> Human nature is shaped by our environment
* Notable figures: Pavlov, Thorndike, Watson (Little Albert experiment), Skinner

<br />

# The Humanistic Perspective

* Emphasizes free will, personal growth, self-actualization, and the attempt to find meaning in one's existence
* Rejects psychodynamics
* The **Postive Psychology Movement** -> focusing on strengths and fulfillments
* Notable figures: Maslow (Hierarchy of Needs), Rogers

<br />

# The Cognitive Perspective

* Examines nature of mind
* Perceptions are organized so that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
* How mental processes influence behaviours
* Notable figures: Ebbinghaus -> Gestalt Psychology (1920s)
* **Gestalt** = perception and problem solving
    + figure-ground
    + closure
    + proximity
    + similarity

<br />

# Modern Cognitive Psychology

* Notable figure: Elizabeth Loftus
* The **Misinformation Effect** -> Impacts eyewitness memory and testimony
* Factors can distort memory

<br />

# The Socialcultural Perspective

* Examines how the social environment and culturla learning influence our behaviour, thoughts, and feelings  
* **Social Psychology Component** - how the presence of other people influence our behaviour, thoughts, and feelings  
* **Cultural Component** - Enduring values, beliefs, behavious, and traditions that are shared by a large group of people and passed from one generation to the next Ex. Individualism vs. Collectivism
* Asch Experiment - influence the presence of others will have on our decision-making (conformity)

# The Biological Perspective

* Examines how brain processes and other bodily functions regulate behaviour  
* **Behavioural Neuroscience** - examines brain processes and other physiological functions that underlie our behaviours, sensory experiences, emotions, and thoughts  
* Notable figures: Lashley, Scoville, Milner, Hebb  
* Most famous person: patient H.M. (memory loss)  
	+ to alleviate seizures related to epilepsy, had brain surgery
	+ no more seizures, but caused him to have amnesia (wasn't able to create new memories)  
* Another example: Capgras Syndrome

## Chapter 2 - Studying Behaviour Scientifically ##

+ Scientific attitudes
+ Scientific process
+ Types of variables
+ Correlational research
+ Experimental research
+ Statistics

**Scientific Attitudes**

+ Kitty Genovese Murder (1964) - Bystander Apathy
+ Darley & Latane: Why would nobody call the police? Was there something more going on here?
+ Darley & Latane:  
	+ Rather than apaty, perhaps it was "diffusion of responsibility"
	+ Created an if-then question
	+ In an emergency, IF multiple bystanders are present, THEN the likelihood that any one bystander will intervene is reduced
	+ They designed an experiment to test their hypothesis

**The Correlational Method**

+ Study relationships between variables
+ Variable: anything that can be measured
+ E.g. more smokes, more cancer; higher IQ, more money
+ Relationship between variables is shown by a statistic, the **correlation coefficient (r)**
+ r can be anything between -1.0 and +1.0 (STAT 231 amirite)
+ Examples: marijuana and GPA; marijuana and junk food consumption; GPA and height

**Methods of Research**

+ Correlational Research
+ Experimental

**Case Studies**

+ An in-depth analysis of an individual a group, or an event
+ Data may be gathered through observation, interviews, psychological tests, task performances, physiological recordings, or archival records
+ Examples of key case studies: H.M., Phineas Gage
+ **Advantages:**
	+ Allows for the study of rare phenomenon
	+ A case study may challenge the validity of a theory or a widely held scientific belief
	+ Can be a source of new ideas and hypotheses that can be further investigated through controlled experiments
+ Not just people, events as well
+ Examples: Flashbulb memories (Assassination of JFK, the Challenger Explosion, Death of Diana, 9/11)
+ Monumental events that impact a large group of people
+ **Limitations**:
	+ Poor method for determining "cause-effect"
	+ Case studies may not generalize to other people's situations
	+ Observers may not be objective in gathering and interpreting the data
+ We should be skeptical about case studies

**Hemispheric lateralization**

+ Our brains have left and right cerebral hemispheres
+ Left brain vs. Right brain
+ Lateralization - refers to the relatively greater location of a function in one hemisphere or the other

**Neural Bases of Behaviour**  

  + Brain: 3 lbs, mass of tissue made of neurons
  + Neurons = building blocks of the nervous system
  + 100 Billion neurons at birth

**Neuron Structures etc.** - Soma, Dendrites, axons, myelin sheath, node of Ranvier  
**Synaptic Transmission** - synaptic vesicles, axon terminal, postsynaptic membrane

##Brain##

+ Cerebral Cortex: outermost layer
  + Many connections
  + frontal (motor cortex, complex cognition), temporal (auditory, language), occipital (visual), parietal (sensory)
+ Broca's and Wernicke's Area
+ Aphasia (Broca's, Wernicke's) - Partial/Total loss of the ability to communicate
+ Neural Plasticity - the ability for neurons to change in structure and function; brain alterations begin in the uterus and continues throughout life; impacted by genetic factors and environment
+ Synesthesia - one type of stimulation evokes the sensation of another

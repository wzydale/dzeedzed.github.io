**Psychology = Study of the behaviour and the mind**  
Behaviour = actions and responses  
Mind = internal states and processes

Psychology is a science. It is a systematic gathering of empirical evidence.

**4 Central Goals of Psychology**

1. Describe how people and animals behave
2. Explain and understand causes of these behaviours
3. Predict behaviours
4. Influence/Control behaviours through knowledge and control of its causes to enhance human welfare

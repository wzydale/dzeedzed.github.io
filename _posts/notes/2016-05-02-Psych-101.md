**Psychology = Study of the behaviour and the mind**  
Behaviour = actions and responses
Mind = internal states and processes, such as thoughts and feelings

Psychology is a science. It is a systematic gathering and evaluating of empirical evidence.

Subfields: Biopsychology, developmental, experimental, industrial-organizational, personality, social etc.

**4 Central Goals of Psychology**

1. Describe how people and animals behave
2. Explain and understand causes of these behaviours
3. Predict behaviours under certain conditions
4. Influence/Control behaviours through knowledge and control of its causes to enhance human welfare

Psychology can be made up of different perspectives.

<br />

# The Structuralism Perspective #

Wilhelm Wundt -> First psychology lab with Titchener -> Founded the **Structuralism** approach

* Mind -> studied by breaking it into basic components
* Used "introspection" to study sensations
* Gave way to **functionalism** (functions of consciousness)
* "Describe inner experiences"

<br />

# The Functionalism Perspective #

* Our hands -> "Why do we have hands"
* Ask similar questions about mental processes and behaviours

<br />

# The Psychodynamic Perspective #

* Searches for causes of behaviours within the inner workings of our personality
* Emphasizes the role of consciousness
* **Psychoanalysis** is the analysis of internal and primarily unconscious psychological forces

<br />

# The Behavioural Perspective

* Focuses on the role of the external environment in governing our actions
* John Locke -> Tabula Rasa -> Human nature is shaped by our environment
* Notable figures: Pavlov, Thorndike, Watson (Little Albert experiment), Skinner

<br />

# The Humanistic Perspective

* Emphasizes free will, personal growth, self-actualization, and the attempt to find meaning in one's existence
* Rejects psychodynamics
* The **Postive Psychology Movement** -> focusing on strengths and fulfillments
* Notable figures: Maslow (Hierarchy of Needs), Rogers

<br />

# The Cognitive Perspective

* Examines nature of mind
* Perceptions are organized so that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
* How mental processes influence behaviours
* Notable figures: Ebbinghaus -> Gestalt Psychology (1920s)
* **Gestalt** = perception and problem solving
    + figure-ground
    + closure
    + proximity
    + similarity

<br />

# Modern Cognitive Psychology

* Notable figure: Elizabeth Loftus
* The **Misinformation Effect** -> Impacts eyewitness memory and testimony
* Factors can distort memory

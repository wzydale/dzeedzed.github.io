**Psychology = Study of the behaviour and the mind**  
Behaviour = actions and responses
Mind = internal states and processes, such as thoughts and feelings

Psychology is a science. It is a systematic gathering and evaluating of empirical evidence.

Subfields: Biopsychology, developmental, experimental, industrial-organizational, personality, social etc.

**4 Central Goals of Psychology**

1. Describe how people and animals behave
2. Explain and understand causes of these behaviours
3. Predict behaviours under certain conditions
4. Influence/Control behaviours through knowledge and control of its causes to enhance human welfare

Psychology can be made up of different perspectives.

<br />

# The Structuralism Perspective #

Wilhelm Wundt -> First psychology lab with Titchener -> Founded the **Structuralism** approach

* Mind -> studied by breaking it into basic components
* Used "introspection" to study sensations
* Gave way to **functionalism** (functions of consciousness)
* "Describe inner experiences"

<br />

# The Functionalism Perspective #

* Our hands -> "Why do we have hands"
* Ask similar questions about mental processes and behaviours

<br />

# The Psychodynamic Perspective #

* Searches for causes of behaviours within the inner workings of our personality
* Emphasizes the role of consciousness
* **Psychoanalysis** is the analysis of internal and primarily unconscious psychological forces

<br />

# The Behavioural Perspective

* Focuses on the role of the external environment in governing our actions
* John Locke -> Tabula Rasa -> Human nature is shaped by our environment
* Notable figures: Pavlov, Thorndike, Watson (Little Albert experiment), Skinner

<br />

# The Humanistic Perspective

* Emphasizes free will, personal growth, self-actualization, and the attempt to find meaning in one's existence
* Rejects psychodynamics
* The **Postive Psychology Movement** -> focusing on strengths and fulfillments
* Notable figures: Maslow (Hierarchy of Needs), Rogers

<br />

# The Cognitive Perspective

* Examines nature of mind
* Perceptions are organized so that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
* How mental processes influence behaviours
* Notable figures: Ebbinghaus -> Gestalt Psychology (1920s)
* **Gestalt** = perception and problem solving
    + figure-ground
    + closure
    + proximity
    + similarity

<br />

# Modern Cognitive Psychology

* Notable figure: Elizabeth Loftus
* The **Misinformation Effect** -> Impacts eyewitness memory and testimony
* Factors can distort memory

<br />

# The Socialcultural Perspective

* Examines how the social environment and culturla learning influence our behaviour, thoughts, and feelings  
* **Social Psychology Component** - how the presence of other people influence our behaviour, thoughts, and feelings  
* **Cultural Component** - Enduring values, beliefs, behavious, and traditions that are shared by a large group of people and passed from one generation to the next Ex. Individualism vs. Collectivism
* Asch Experiment - influence the presence of others will have on our decision-making (conformity)

# The Biological Perspective

* Examines how brain processes and other bodily functions regulate behaviour  
* **Behavioural Neuroscience** - examines brain processes and other physiological functions that underlie our behaviours, sensory experiences, emotions, and thoughts  
* Notable figures: Lashley, Scoville, Milner, Hebb  
* Most famous person: patient H.M. (memory loss)  
	+ to alleviate seizures related to epilepsy, had brain surgery
	+ no more seizures, but caused him to have amnesia (wasn't able to create new memories)  
* Another example: Capgras Syndrome

## Chapter 2 - Studying Behaviour Scientifically ##

+ Scientific attitudes
+ Scientific process
+ Types of variables
+ Correlational research
+ Experimental research
+ Statistics

**Scientific Attitudes**

+ Kitty Genovese Murder (1964) - Bystander Apathy
+ Darley & Latane: Why would nobody call the police? Was there something more going on here?
+ Darley & Latane:  
	+ Rather than apaty, perhaps it was "diffusion of responsibility"
	+ Created an if-then question
	+ In an emergency, IF multiple bystanders are present, THEN the likelihood that any one bystander will intervene is reduced
	+ They designed an experiment to test their hypothesis

**The Correlational Method**

+ Study relationships between variables
+ Variable: anything that can be measured
+ E.g. more smokes, more cancer; higher IQ, more money
+ Relationship between variables is shown by a statistic, the **correlation coefficient (r)**
+ r can be anything between -1.0 and +1.0 (STAT 231 amirite)
+ Examples: marijuana and GPA; marijuana and junk food consumption; GPA and height

**Methods of Research**

+ Correlational Research
+ Experimental

**Case Studies**

+ An in-depth analysis of an individual a group, or an event
+ Data may be gathered through observation, interviews, psychological tests, task performances, physiological recordings, or archival records
+ Examples of key case studies: H.M., Phineas Gage
+ **Advantages:**
	+ Allows for the study of rare phenomenon
	+ A case study may challenge the validity of a theory or a widely held scientific belief
	+ Can be a source of new ideas and hypotheses that can be further investigated through controlled experiments
+ Not just people, events as well
+ Examples: Flashbulb memories (Assassination of JFK, the Challenger Explosion, Death of Diana, 9/11)
+ Monumental events that impact a large group of people
+ **Limitations**:
	+ Poor method for determining "cause-effect"
	+ Case studies may not generalize to other people's situations
	+ Observers may not be objective in gathering and interpreting the data
+ We should be skeptical about case studies

**Hemispheric lateralization**

+ Our brains have left and right cerebral hemispheres
+ Left brain vs. Right brain
+ Lateralization - refers to the relatively greater location of a function in one hemisphere or the other

**Neural Bases of Behaviour**  

  + Brain: 3 lbs, mass of tissue made of neurons
  + Neurons = building blocks of the nervous system
  + 100 Billion neurons at birth

**Neuron Structures etc.** - Soma, Dendrites, axons, myelin sheath, node of Ranvier  
**Synaptic Transmission** - synaptic vesicles, axon terminal, postsynaptic membrane

## The Human Brain ##

+ Cerebral Cortex: outermost layer
  + Many connections
  + frontal (motor cortex, complex cognition), temporal (auditory, language), occipital (visual), parietal (sensory)
+ Broca's and Wernicke's Area
+ Aphasia (Broca's, Wernicke's) - Partial/Total loss of the ability to communicate
+ Neural Plasticity - the ability for neurons to change in structure and function; brain alterations begin in the uterus and continues throughout life; impacted by genetic factors and environment
+ Synesthesia - one type of stimulation evokes the sensation of another

## Chapter 1 ##

Psychology = scientific study of behaviour (actions/responses that we can directly observe) and the mind (internal states and processes; must be inferred)

**Structuralism**: 1879, Wundt & Titchener: the analysis of the mind in terms of its basic elements; introspection (looking within); sensations = basic elements of consciousness  

**Functionalism**: psychology should study the functions of consciousness; influenced by evolutionary theory; William James; gave rise to cognitive and evolutionary psychology  

**Psychodynamic**: searches for causes of behaviour within the inner workings of our personality (our unique pattern of traits, emotions and motives); emphasizes the role of unconscious processes; Sigmund Freud; Psychoanalysis: analysis of internal and primarily unconscious psychological forces; Defense mechanisms: techniques that help us cope with anxiety and pain of traumatic experiences, e.g. repression; dominated early 1900s, continue to exist  

**Modern Psychodynamic**: object relations theories focus on how early experiences with caregivers shape the views that people form of themselves

**Behaviourism**: role of the external environment in governing our actions; emphasizes environmental control of behaviour through learning; rooted in British empiricism; Ivan Pavlov: dog salivation experiment; Edward Thorndike: organisms learn through the consequences of their actions; 1913, John B. Watson: observable behaviour, "human beings are products of their learning experiences", "give me a dozen infants" quote; B.F. Skinner: "a person does not act upon the world, the world acts upon him", how behaviour is shaped by rewarding and punishing  

**Cognitive Behaviourism**: learning experiences and the environment influence our expectations and other thoughts, and in turn our thoughts influence behaviour; influential  

**Humanism**: free will, personal growth, attempt to find meaning in one's existence; rejected psychodynamic concepts; rejects unconsciousness; denied behaviourism (humans = reactors molded by environment); Abraham Maslow: inborn force toward self-actualization, reaching of one's individual potential; importance of personal choice and responsibility, self-worth; meaning of existence resides in our own hands; must take personal responsibility to turn things around; Carl Rogers: humanist, pioneer of psychotherapy; positive psychology movement: human strengths, fulfillment and optimal living

**Cognitive Perspective**: nature of the mind and how mental processes influence behaviour; humans = information processors whose actions are governed by thought; structuralism + functionalism; Hermann Ebbinghaus: studied memory; Gestalt (whole/organization) psychology -> examines how elements of experience are organized into wholes (greater than the sum of its parts); Jean Piaget: children's thinking processes become more sophisticated with age

**Modern Cognitive Perspective**: study of mental processes; processes by which people reason and make decisions, devise solutions to problems, form perceptions and mental images; Elizabeth Loftus: memory and how we distort it; Cognitive neuroscience: electrical recording and brain-imaging to examine brain activity during cognitive tasks; Social constructivism: reality is our own mental creation, the product of a shared way of thinking among members of social groups

**Sociocultural Perspective**: exami nes how the social environment and cultural learning influence our behaviour, thoughts, and feelings; culture = enduring values, beliefs, behaviours, and traditions that are shared by a large group of people and passed down generationally; norms = rules that specify what behaviour is acceptable and expected for members; cultural psychology: how culture is transmitted to its members and examines psychological similarities and differences; individualism: emphasis on personal goals and self-identity based on one's own attributes and achievements; collectivism: individual goals are subordinated to those of the group; Asch Experiement: conformity

**Biological Perspective**: how brain processes and other bodily functions regulate behaviour; Behavioural neuroscience: brain processes and other physiological functions that underlie our behaviour, sensory experiences, emotions, and thoughts; Karl Lashley, Donald Hebb: brain's role in leraning, trained rats to run mazes, mapped brain regions involved in specific psychological functions

<br />

## Chapter 2 ##

**Correlational Method**: Study relationships among variables; behaviours, events, characteristics; e.g. more smokes, more cancer; correlation coefficienct (r)

**Case Studies**: in-depth analysis of an individual, group, or event; data may be gathered through observation, interviews, psychological tests, task performances, physiologicla recordings, or archival records; e.g. H.M., David from the Capgras Delusion video (Capgras = irrational belief that a familiar person or place has been replaced with an exact duplicate), Phineas Gage

**Experimental**: experimental group and control group

**Naturalistic Observation**

**Survey Research**

<br />

## Chapter 3 ##

**Phineas Gage**: Damaged ventromedial frontal lobe -> change in personality

**The Brain**:

  + Cerebral Cortex: outermost layer of brain, many connections to other areas
    + Frontal: complex cognition, motor cortex
    + Temporal: auditory, language
    + Occipital: visual
    + Parietal: sensory
  + Neurons:
    + Cell body (Soma): contains biochemical structure that keep the neuron alive
    + Dendrites: antennae that collect messages from other neurons
    + Axon: covered by myelin sheath, conducts electrical impulses away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands
    + Synaptic Transmission: synthesis of neurotransmitter -> storage in synaptic vesicles -> release into synaptic space -> binding to receptor sites -> deactivation through reuptake or breakdown
    + Broca's and Wernicke's Area: Broca's (expressive) aphasia: trouble speaking fluently but comprehension is preserved; Wernicke's (fluent) aphasia: unable to understand language in its written or spoken form
    + Neural plasticity: ability of neurons to change in structure and function; impacted by genetic factors and environment; greater number of synapses results in quicker and more complete recovery
  + Synesthesia: one type of stimulation evokes the sensation of another; possible explanations: cross connections of the senses at the neural level, OR we are all born with it, as brain develops it fades and changes

**Motivation**:

  + Olds and Miller (1953) - mistakenly placed an electrode into a rat's hypothalamus
  + Started repeating the previous activity in hopes of receiving the stimulation again
  + Found the pleasure centre of the brain = Nucleus Accumbens

**Human Aggression, Criminal Behaviour, and the Frontal Cortex**:

  + Psychopathy: emotional dysfunction and antisocial behaviour; extreme form of antisocial personality disorder
  + PCL-R (Psychopathy checklist): shallow affect (superficial emotional responsiveness), callousness and lack of empathy, parasitic lifestyle, poor behavioural controls, and sexual promiscuity
  + Train Dilemma
  + Face recognition: some believe face recognition is based on dedicated brain mechanisms
  + Face-inversion effect: inversion harms the ability to recognize faces much more than it does other objects
  + Prosopagnasia = "face blindness" -> gives us first hand knowledge, demonstration that there is a specialized area of the brain that handles these types of processes

<br />

## Chapter 4 ##

  + The Jim Twins
  + **Chrmosomes and Genes**:
    + Hippocrates - suggested that semem contains some sort of design for the formation of offspring
    + Gregor Mendel - garden peas -> modern genetic theory
    + Dominant and recessive genes
    + Genetic Influences: genotype = the specific genetic makeup of an individual, phenotype = observable characteristics

## Chapter 5

### The Contribution of Context

### Absolute Threshold

+ Intensity at which a stimulus can be detected 50% of the time
  + Lower the absolute threshold - higher the sensitivity
+ A key distinction here is that absolute threshold measures the level that we can actually report sensing a stimuli
+ We therefore have to consciously be aware of the stimuli to successfully report it
+ What about stimuli that is just below our conscious awareness or our absolute threshold?

### Subliminal Perception

+ A stimulus that is so weak or brief that, although it is received by the senses, it cannot be perceived consciously
+ Late 1950's: James Vicary (PR Exec) arranged to have subliminal messages flashed on a theatre screen during a movie
  + Messages said: "Drink Coca-Cola", "Eat Popcorn"
  + Popcorn sales went up by 50%, Coke 18%
  + Public were outraged, fear of brainwashing
  + National Association of Broadcasters outlawed subliminal messages on American Tv
  + PROBLEM: Results under controlled experiments could not be replicated; Hoax to revive his ad agency
+ Studies were finding that subliminal messages didn't really change consumer behaviour
+ But research started to focus on more subtle processes, like our attitudes: Can subliminal messages impact our attitudes?
+ Krosnick (1992):
  + Showed participants 9 slides showing pictures of people
  + Half of participants received negative subliminal messages just prior
  + Half received positive subliminal messages just prior
  + FINDING: Participants expressed somewhat negative attitudes towards negatively "primed" individuals, compared with their positively primed participants
  + Stimuli above absolute threshold is better than subliminal messages

### Visual Attention

+ Inattentional blindness
  + Failure to notice obvious changes in visual scene
  + Sometimes termed change blindness
  + Simons and Chabris (1999)
    + Subjects watched and attached to a video
    + Over 1/2 failed to notice bizarre event
  + Change blindness

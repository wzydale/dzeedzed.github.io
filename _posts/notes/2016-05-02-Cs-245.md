## Propositional Logic ##

LOGIC = systematic study of the principles of reasoning and inference

+ To model the computer hardware, software, and embedded systems we create/encounter, in order to reason about those objects in a rigorous manner
+ To understand how to develop systems that can themselves apply reason and make inferences (AI)
+ To define a computer required logic (Turing 1936)
+ CS gave the first definition of "rigorous argument" (an argument that may be checked by a machine; machine returns true if proof is correct)

**Example:** If the train arrives late and there are no taxis at the station, then John is late for his meeting.

John is not late for his meeting.

The train did arrive late.

__Therefore__, there were taxis at the station.

Q: Is this argument __valid__? Why/Why not?

Q: What is the structure of this argument?  
A: If p and not q, then r. Not r. p. Therefore q.

p = "the train arrives late"  
q = "there are taxis at the station"  
r = "John is late for his meeting"  

What if we reassign meanings to p, q, and r? We will get an equally valid argument.

The factual content of statements (p, q, r) doesn't matter. The relationships among the statements govern the argument.

So what constitutes a "statement"?  
What do logical relationships mean?

We shall start with **Propositional Logic**, a basic form of logic.

A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**.

Either the proposition is true, or the proposition is false. It is never both true and false.

e.g. If Kathleen Wynne is a Liberal, then Stephen Harper is a Tory.

p->q: If p then q; p is sufficient for q, q is necessary for p.

p <-> q: p if and only if q (p iff q); p is equivalent to q; p exactly if q; p is necessary and sufficient for q.

**Translating from English to propositional logic examples:**

1. She is clever and hard-working  
Let p be "she is clever" and q be "she is hard-working"  
Then we get (p ^ q)

2. If he does not study hard then he will fail  
Let p be "he studies hard" and q be "he will fail"  
Then we get ((NOT p) -> q)

3. If it rains, he will be at home; otherwsie he will go to the market or to school.  
Let p be "it rains", q be "he will be at home", r be "he will go to the market", s be "he will go to school"  
Then we get ((p -> q) ^ ((NOT p) -> (r v s)))

Some sentences are not propositions:

+ interrogative: where shall we go to eat?
+ imperative: please pass the salt
+ ambiguous: time flies like an arrow
+ nonsense: uwgod
+ otherwise problematic: This sentence is false

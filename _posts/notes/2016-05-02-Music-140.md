    3. The Emergence of the Middle Class, who possesses **disposable income**
    4. Large Urban Populations (as a result of the rural-to-urban shift)
    5. Copyright Law -> music itself is an **idea** (Law originated from Queen Mary, who also started stationary companies; musicians have to register and sell royalty)

        2. Race: Black, regardless of class or location
        3. Hillbilly: Origins in poor, white, rural -> now migrating to urban areas (particular in Southern US) -> Country

    + Products of the music industry were sheet music and recordings
    + Sheet music dominated recordings until the the late 1920s
    + While sheet music was still important, by the end of WWII, the recording industry had come to dominated

<br />

+ Where Rock 'n Roll began
+ Work songs:
  + Used to pass time, set pace, or coordinate work
  + Song leader
  + "Floating pool of verse"
  + E.g. "Old Alabama" (1947)

+ Folk Music:
  + Performed by amateurs (derived from the French word for lovers; means "doing it for free")
  + For self or community entertainment
  + Oral tradition
  + More concern with tradition than innovation (lacking "self-consciousness")

+ African Retentions:
  + Interest in percussive and distorted timbres
  + Value in the Ecstatic and the Cathartic
  + Rhythmic complexity - syncopation
  + Use of "riffs", a small, self-contained, music gesture that is repeated over and over, becomes the basis of a longer composition (opposite: motif)
  + Use of "call and response" -> West African perspective: no difference between performer and audience. Audience sing and dance with performer (in contrast to Western concert); E.g. YouTube video "Pop Song", Jon Lajoie

+ American Civil War (1861-1865) and Post-Slavery (1865-)
  + Institutionalized racism

      + a-a-b lyric pattern
      + Call and response between guitar and voice
      + Floating pool of verse

+ Robert Johnson (1911-1938)
  + Defined standards for blues guitar
  + Peak: November 1936 and June 1937 - The Complete Recordings
  + Mythic character
  + E.g. "Sweet Home Chicago", November 1936: added six/Boogie-woogie pattern (note: take a body of the song and put it into intro and outro (end of each verse is similar to intro))

Word of the Class: Self-Conscious (indicator of  professional performer; unlike folk performer; Actively thinking about how to innovate and improve in order to gain more audience)

**Changes in Technology**  

+ Mechanical Reproduction
  + 1877: Edison invented phonograph (gave rise to gramophone)
  + 1892-1912: Transition from cylinders to disks
  + 1925: Industry standard speed set to 78 RPM
+ What was recorded?
  + Sheet music/TPA(Tin Pan Alley)
  + Black music/rural Southern white music not recorded because:
    + cultural chauvinism (people who control the technology did not think other cultures were worth recording)
    + Rural areas - less sales
+ Commercial Radio, 1920
  + January 1922 - 28 stations -> December 1922 - 570 stations
  + Controlled by only a few networks (CBS, NBC, Mutual)

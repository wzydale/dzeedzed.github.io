### What is Popular Music?###

+ Dependent on the development of
    1. Different from "folk" and "art" music genres
    2. The Industrial Revolution changes the system of barter economy to a system of monetary currency (also contributed to 3, the Middle Class, and 4, the growth of urban populations)
    3. The Emergence of the Middle Class, who possesses **disposable income**
    4. Large Urban Populations (as a result of the rural-to-urban shift)
    5. Copyright Law -> music itself is an **idea** (Law originated from Queen Mary, who also started stationary companies; musicians have to register and sell royalty)
    6. Technologies of mass production and broadcasting -> records  

<br />

+ By 1945:
    1. End of the "Big Band" era
    2. Big Band had dominated the music industry since the mid 30s

    Example: "Sentimental Journey" (Doris Day, 1944), focuses on instrumental, performed by Les Brown and His Band of Renown

    + Significant figures: Boney Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey
    + Returning to focus on vocalist

    + The music industry divided into 3 distinct categories:
        1. Popular(Pop): White/Middle Class/Urban
        2. Race: Black, regardless of class or location
        3. Hillbilly: Origins in poor, white, rural -> now migrating to urban areas (particular in Southern US) -> Country

    + Products of the music industry were sheet music and recordings
    + Sheet music dominated recordings until the the late 1920s
    + While sheet music was still important, by the end of WWII, the recording industry had come to dominated

<br />

+ Development of the American Music Industry
    + What creates the conditions for popular music to become a consumer product?
        + 1790s to 1830s - Amendments to the copyright law to cover sheet music
        + The Victorian Ballad: **Minstrel Shows** and **Parlour Music**

    + Minstrel Shows
        + Variety show that depicted African-Americans in a racist and stereotypical light
        + Instruments: Guitar, Banjo, Fiddle, also Piano
        + Most important composer: Steven Foster
        + Example: "Massa's in de cold cold ground" (1852)
        + Characteristics: guitar accomaniment and vocal control

    + Parlour Music
        + Industrial Revolution
            + Rise of the Middle Class
            + Luxury item = Piano = symbol of wealth
            + Daughters pursue "leisure" activities
        + Example: "Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms" (Early 1800s) by Thomas Moore
        + Parlous Song - AABA form in terms of melody
        + Characteristics: Piano accomaniment, vocal control, and with themes such as loyalty, honesty, control, and restraint

    + Demand for newly composed songs leads to the increased organization of the music industry

<br />    

+ Tin Pan Alley
    + Charles K. Harris - "After the Ball" (1892): Sheet music sold over 5M copies = "The First Hit Song" -> Why? Urbanization and population growth
    + The success of "After the Ball" gave birth to Tin Pan Alley (TPA)
    + Both a musical style and a place
    + Manhattan in NYC, became the centre of professional music making
    + During the 20s and 30s, 21k publisher and 36k composers in a few blocks in TPA
    + Division of labour: composers, lyricists, publishers, publicity(marketing), and performers
    + Sheet music dominated (though transitioning to recording in the 20s)

**Lyrics**

+ Basic rhyme scheme
+ Syllabic
+ Idealized romance - Beginning and Ending

## African American Music ##

Where black culture emerges from and how characteristics map onto emerging culture after slavery ends

**Background**  

+ Do not get rock'n roll without the slave trade

**North American Slave Trade (1619-1863)**  

+ 1619, First African slaves sold in North America
+ Sahara essentially divides Africa into two:
  1. Northern Africa - more associated with Middle East
  2. South Sub-Saharan Africa
+ Majority of North American slaves came from South Sub-Saharan West Africa
+ Despite salvers' attempts to extinguish slav culture, some aspects such as music, survived, in fact music was omnipresent
+ Where Rock 'n Roll began
+ Work songs:
  + Used to pass time, set pace, or coordinate group work for efficiency (i.e. synchronize axe swings)
  + Help saving lives: by slowing pace, work songs made the group seem at the same pace, making it hard for owners to distinguish sick/slackers
  + "Floating pool of verse": floating verse created by song leader - majority were men, highly valued; had many fragmented verses, made songs up on the spot
  + E.g. "Old Alabama" (1947): Slavery ended 12 years before recording technology, therefore we are not listening to slaves but rather a prison gang; this recording is by prisoners in 1947; song leader initiates and everyone joins in; not just a song, more like a game to keep spirits up - had to discern verse from syllables of song leader

## Folk Music ##

  + Performed by amateurs (derived from the French word for lovers, amore; means "doing it for free", not paid)
  + For self or community entertainment
  + Oral tradition - passed down generationally via experience
  + More concern with tradition than innovation (lacking "self-consciousness")
    + Not professionalization - quest for innovation, to stand out to get noticed; folk culture contrasts this, it focuses on continuity of tradition

+ African Retentions:
  + Interest in percussion and distorted timbres
    + Timbre(tamber) (physical/audible): quality of an instrument that allows identification
    + West African culture has a focus on percussion (drums, but anything that is struck)
    + Distortion: unintended alteration of your signal - West African Perspective: seen as an overflow of intensity/investment of energy
  + Value in the Ecstatic and the Cathartic: Sweat means energy
  + Rhythmic complexity - syncopation
    + Indian music has complex notes and rhythms - no chords or harmonies
  + Use of "riffs", a small, self-contained, music gesture that is repeated over and over, becomes the basis of a longer composition (opposite: motif)
  + Use of "call and response" -> West African perspective: no difference between performer and audience. Audience sing and dance with performer (in contrast to Western concert); E.g. YouTube video "Pop Song", Jon Lajoie

+ American Civil War (1861-1865) and Post-Slavery (1865-)
  + Institutionalized racism
  + Acceleration of rural-to-urban shift
  + New forms of music appear during late 1800s:
    1. Ragtime("The Entertainer") - urban
    2. Jazz - urban
    3. Blues, Country (rural) Blues:
      + Wandering musicians
      + Male vocalist, with acoustic guitar
      + Plaintive vocal sound - lament
      + Themes: travel, economy, and love
      + 12 Measure phrases (known as bars)
      + a-a-b lyric pattern
      + Call and response between guitar and voice
      + Floating pool of verse

+ Robert Johnson (1911-1938)
  + Defined standards for blues guitar
  + Peak: November 1936 and June 1937 - The Complete Recordings
  + Mythic character
  + E.g. "Sweet Home Chicago", November 1936: added six/Boogie-woogie pattern (note: take a body of the song and put it into intro and outro (end of each verse is similar to intro))

Word of the Class: Self-Conscious (indicator of  professional performer; unlike folk performer; Actively thinking about how to innovate and improve in order to gain more audience)

**Changes in Technology**  

+ Mechanical Reproduction
  + 1877: Edison invented phonograph (gave rise to gramophone)
  + 1892-1912: Transition from cylinders to disks
  + 1925: Industry standard speed set to 78 RPM
+ What was recorded?
  + Sheet music/TPA(Tin Pan Alley)
  + Black music/rural Southern white music not recorded because:
    + cultural chauvinism (people who control the technology did not think other cultures were worth recording)
    + Rural areas - less sales
+ Commercial Radio, 1920
  + January 1922 - 28 stations -> December 1922 - 570 stations
  + Controlled by only a few networks (CBS, NBC, Mutual)
  + First radio network: NBC, 1928
  + Very few independent radio stations existed
  + Network radio began to change patterns of consumption form regional to national

## The Rise of the Record Industry ##

+ The record industry concerned - needs to find new markets
+ Ralph Peer - worked for Okeh Records
+ Finding songs (repertoire) and artists (A&R guy - artists and repertoire)
+ 1920 - "Crazy Blues" - Mamie Smith
  + due to institutionalizedracism - black people did not record music
  + first significant recording by AA artists despite origin in 1877
  + song was a minor hit - purchased by white people despite racism
  + black community did not have a lot of purchasing power, thus they were not a targeted market
  + not a Blues song, much more associated to Jazz. Jazz is closely linked to popular music up to post-war
+ Market research in popular music
  + most radio music is TPA
  + Ignored black cultural and southern rural white culture, thought culture was artistically and economically insignificant
  + Peer decided to used records to play what radio did not
+ Introduction of "Hillbilly": Carve that Possum - Uncle Dave Macon, 1927
  + Uncle Dave Macon and the Fruit Jar Drinkers
  + Early origin of country (music of Southeastern states, now called blue bratz) and western
  + More energy/intensity, very hard, on beat


<br />

### Introduction of "Race" ###

+ How Long Blues, 1928, Leroy Carr and Scrapper Blackwell; beginning of guitar solo
  + First recording of AA artists and Blues (1890s, maybe 1880s)
+ Included different styles. The most important one was that it included the next style of Blues: City Blues = music made by country blues artists after they moved to the cities; Relaxed style
+ Instruments had to be louder in city than in country, therefore main instrument went from solo acoustic guitar to piano
+ Black and Southern cultures exposed

### Television ###

+ First demonstration in 1927
+ Experimental and low-resolution broadcasts through the 1930s
+ Network broadcasts begin in 1939
+ By 1945 - 6 stations
+ WWII: TV not helpful towards war effort
+ By 1955 - 411 stations
+ Major nextworks move to Television
  + Televion was a better medium for commercials
  + Commercials were primary revenue source for networks
+ Major networks switching mediums led to more independent, local stations
+ First "Black Appeal" radio station - WDIA Memphis, 1948; 2 pharmacists bought a radio station
+ By 1954, 200 BA radio stations are on the air

Who is listening? Extended Adolescence  
Transistor Radio  

### Gospel ###

The sacred music of black culture, from the culture following the civil war -> spiritual

**Ray Charles(Robinson), 1930-2004**  

+ Born in Albany, GA
+ Blind at age 7, learns music in a school for the blind
+ 1952 Atlantic Records
+ Success with white audiences - heightened level of intensity

**Chicago Electric Blues**  

+ Muddy Waters, 1913-1983
  + Born in Mississippi
  + Played guitar and harmonica
  + Emulated Robert Johnson
  + Moved to Chicago in the early 1940s
  + Switched to electric guitar, 1945
  + 1946, records for Aristocrat Records (would later become Chess Records)

## Recap ##

+ Crossover hits: works done by black artists but were popular on the charts;
+ White teenagers listened to a lot Black music

## Cover Versions: 1954-1956 ##

+ "white" versions of "black" records; did not violate copyright laws; quite legal; crossover->pop chart->within a week or two the same song performed by white artists would be on the chart with it simultaneously->to appease white parents

** Richard Wayne Penniman "Little Richard" **  

+ Born 1932, Macon, GA
+ First big hit: "Tutti Frutti"
+ Released late 1955 on Specialty Records (lyrics revised by Dorothy LaBostrie; she replaced some sexual lyrics with less controversial words)
+ "Crossover" hit: \#2 R&B, \#17 Pop on Billboard

** Pat Boone **  

+ Born 1934
+ Was just breaking as a popstar in 1955
+ Early 1956, released a cover of "Tutti Frutti"

+ The Chords: Form: 1x through AABA, with interludes; Voice: distorted - use of lower octave in B; Solo: Sax - distorted timbre, sexual metaphor
+ The Crew Cuts: Form: 2x through AABA - clearly stated; Voice: Clean, no use of lower octave; Solo: No solo - repeats of "Sh-boom" group vocal - timpani joke (cartoon reference)
+ Racist? Or a continuation of TPA traditions? Record companies -> simply business
+ The Chords: \#3 R&B / \#5 Pop
+ The Crew Cuts: no R&B / \#1 Pop for 9 weeks - Song of the Year (not The Chords)
+ Both white and black artists performing in this new style: a mix of pop, C&W, and R&B, targeted teenagers - Rock 'n Roll (term attributed to Alan Freed; term goes at least back to the 1800s out of Black culture)

** Bill Haley and the Comets **  

+ Born in 1925

+ Independent share: 1955: 21% / 1959: 66%

### Racism

Reaction against the perceived intergration of youth

Birth of ROck and ROll coincides the mergence of the Civil Rights Movement
+ May 1954: Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka: Separate is not Equal
  + Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional
  + Overturned state-sponsored racial segragration supported by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)
+ December 1955: Rosa Parks - Montgomery Bus Boycott
  + political and social protest against racial segregation
+ Freedom Rides / Lunch Counter Sit-ins
  + African-Americans and sympathetic Americans
  + Sit together while crossing state lines
  + Lunch Counter Sit-ins: 1960: Greensboro, North Carolina
+ Martin Luther King King Jr.: Non-violent protest
+ Dislike of Rock 'n' Roll is linked to middle-class white fears regarding the growing strength of the Civil Rights' movement; RnR considered inferior culture

### The Great Extinction

+ March 1958: Elvis drafted into army
+ December 1959: Chuck Berry arrested under the "Mann Act" (aka White Slave Traffic Act)
+ May 1958: Jerry Lee Lewis - Marriage to 13-year-old cousin becomes public

+ February 1959: Buddy Holly - died in a plane crash along with Ritchie Valens and "The Big Bopper" (JP Richardson) = End of the Golden Age, song "The Day Music Died", February 3, 1959

## The In-Between Years (1959-1963)

+ The end of the Golden Age of Rock and Roll, to the arrival of The Beatles (February 1964)
+ Vacuum created by the loss of so many of the stars of the Golden Age creates a space for the Major Record companies to reassert control over the popular music industry
+ They begin to create music similar to 1950's Rock and Roll, but produced within the Division-Of-Labour system favoured by the major labels

### Dance Craze
  + E.g. "The Locomotion", Little Eva (Gofiin, King), 1962
  + Songs are written specifically for the new teen demographic. Romantic (non-sexualized) love and dancing
  + Teen idols: clean-cut, idealized boyfriend - no "bad boy" image from the Golden Age
  + Bobby Vinton: "Blue Velvet", 1963
    + Composed in 1950
    + Hit for Tony Bennett in 1951
  + Most of the newer artists did not write songs - where were they coming from?
  + From a new generation of TPA-style songwriters working in the new style of Rock and Roll
  + Many came from The Brill Building
  + Neil Diamond, Carol King, Burt Bacharach, Marvin Hamlisch (EGOT), Ellie Greenwich, Barry Mann
  + Don Kirshaner / Al Nevins Aldon Music
  + Pop music - TPA approach

### The Rise of the Producer

+ Magnetophon: Sgt. Jack Mullin in Signal Corps in the US Army;
  + He discovered a magnetophon in Nazi Germany at the end of WWII
  + Magnetophone = First high-quality reel-to-reel tape recorder
  + 1947: Mullin demonstrated tape recorder to Bing Crosby (who invented the laugh track)
  + Bing Crosby invested in the founding Ampex
  + Inexpensive, mass-produced tape recorders lower the cost of operating a recording studio
  + Leads to a boom in independent record companies, which in turn is part of what makes the golden age of Rock'n'Roll possible
  + 1948: Bing Crosby gve one of the first commercially produced reel-to-reel tape recorder to Les Paul

### Les Paul (1915-2009)

  + Jazz, Pop, Country
  + 1941: "The Log"
  + 1952: Gibson Les Paul
  + Les Paul wished to create recordings by layering performance
  + Assisted in the devlopment of the "multitrack" tape recorder
  + Example: 1953, "Sitting on Top of the World", Les Paul with Mary Ford
    + When did this performance occur?
      + Multitrack recording redefines the process of recording. Reproduction to Production
  + During the In-Between Years, the recording industry begins the transition from recording complete songs in a single "take" to the use of multitrack recording

### Phil Spector

  + The "Wall of Sound"
  + 1963, The Ronettes, "Be My Baby" (Barry, Greenwich, Spector)

Two other styles of music become imporant although neither fit the Division-Of-Labour model.

## The Folk Festival

+ Many of the teen fans of the Golden Age are now in their early 20s
+ Now in university, many are looking for music that is more "serious"
+ Folk music

### Pre WWII

+ Folk music, political left, Union Movement
+ Woody Guthrie: "This machine kills fascists"
+ The Weavers: Pete Seeger
+ "This Land is Your Land" (Woody Guthrie, 1940) performed by The Weavers
  + instruments and vocal timbre
  + lyric content
  + successful from late 1940s to 1953
  + "blacklisted" in 1953 because of left-wing connection

### HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) and McCarthyism (1947-1956)

+

### Late 1950s / Early 1960s - Baby Book reaches college

+ interest in "serious" music
+ The Kingston Trio / Peter Paul and Mary
  + similiar to ealier music but more "produced" - smoother sounding, more "arranged"

<br />

### Bob Dylan

+ 1961-1965 Traditional folk singer songwriter
+ **A Hard Rain's a Gonna Fall** (1963)

  + instrumental tracks
+ The Beach Boys
+ 1952 -
+ The Pendletones (original name)
+ May 1963 - Surfin' USA (Chuck Berry)
+ Brian Wilson - Creative force

### Decline in popularity through late 1960s - why?

1. Brian Wilson's mental illness
2. Changes in approach to popular music (1960s) - Too optimistic, too naive

Total worth: $200M in 1954  
Total worth: $600M end of golden age, mid to late 60s  
Stayed flat during the in-between years (60s) -> holding pattern  
After The Beatles: $1B

**TEST 2 MATERIAL**

### The British Invasion

+ US in early 60s
+ Opinion with Kennedy (Camelot) / ML King, Civil Rights
+ JFK "the outsider" -> very young, Catholic (American presidents were never Catholic) -> champion of civil rights who listens to young people -> "Anything is possible"
+ "The New Frontier"
+ August 1963 - Washington, MLK "I Have A Dream"
+ Kennedy assissinated November 22, 1963, Dallas TX
+ February 1964 - The Beatles arrived in New York

### Post-War Britain

+ Return to DIY culture
+ Lack of entertainment culture due to crumbled infrastructure
+ New style of music: Skiffle (3-6 guitar players, could not afford bass, broomhandle and string on box "washtub")
+ The Quarrymen
  + July 1957 - John Lennon / Paul McCartney (vocals and guitar) began to write songs together (important: they both wrote songs)
  + Neither of them could play guitar solos
  + February 1958 - George Harrison ("Lead" guitar)
  + January 1960 - Stu Sutcliffe (Bass)

    CS 241 - Foundations of Sequential Programs
    Instructor: Kevin Lanctot
    Location: RCH 309
    Time: Tuesdays and Thursdays 8:30am - 9:50am
    Term: Winter 2017

## January 3, 2017 - Lecture 1 ##

## Course Overview

Purpose: To understand what happens when you compile and run a program

High-level languages (CS 241) -> Machine code (CS 251)

**Major topics:**

+ Machine architecture and assembly language
+ Assemblers, linkers, loaders
+ Regualr languages and scanning
+ Context-free languages and parsing
+ Semantic analysis and code generation
+ Runtime organization and data layout

## Marking Scheme ##

+ Assignments (25%, 10 assignments, due Fridays at 5pm)
  + Public and release cases
  + 3 release tokens which takes 12 hours to regenerate
+ Midterm exam (25%, 4:30pm, Wednesday, March 1, 2017)
+ Final exam (50%)

## Recommended Course Texts

+ Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy
+ BoCD (Basics of Compiler Design) by Mogensen

## Lectures 1, 2 ##

**Key Ideas**

+ Binary, decimal, two's complement
+ Addition and subtraction

## January 10, 2017 - Lecture 3 ##

+ MIPS (binary) reference
  + For each instruction, there is a name, assembly language mnemonic, binary, and MIPS meaning

```
PC <- 0
while (1) {
  fetch word from RAM at address in PC (RAM[PC]) into IR
  PC <- PC + 4
  execute instruction in IR
}
```

+ MIPS Assembly Language (CS241 edition) Reference
  + MIPS assembly language programs are text files
  + Each line is either NULL or contains an instruction
  + Each line has:
    + 0 or more labels (placeholders, used by goto instructions)
    + 0 or 1 instructions
    + Comments (optional) started by a colon
  + Example:
    ```assembly
    jr $3
    jr $3 ;helloWorld
    ```
  + Example:
    ```assembly
    (blank line) NULL LINE
    foo: bar: diff: beq $1, $1, 1
    boo:
    ; comment (this is a null line)
    bah: ; comment after a label
    ```
  + Each non-null line contains an instruction
  + Each instruction consists of an mnemonic and operands
    + Format: mnemonic [operands]
    + Possible mnemonics: .word, add, sub, mul, jr, jalr, etc.
    + Possible operands: decimal numbers, hex, ints
      + Up to 2<super>32</super>-1 down to -2<super>31</super>

STAT 231 is the reverse of STAT 230. E.g. We toss a coin 100 times, we get 60 heads. In STAT 230, we calculate the probability of that happening (binomial distribution, 100 and 0.5, P(X=60)) with all the parameters given (P = 0.5 to get a head for a fair coin). In STAT 231, we try to find the parameters by experiments, and try to infer what we can say about the "fairness" of the coin.

MLB: Between 1901-1941, batters with BA .400+: 11. 1941 onwards: 0. Why? Use statistics to find out.

Kansas Weathermen: They are correct about whether it will rain the next day about 85% of the time. Good record, right? However, it only rains about 10% of the time in Kansas. So if I go to the weather broadcasting station and say "no rain tomorrow" and then go home, I will be statistically more accuarate that these meteorologists.

Baseball Pundits: Pundits are right about the outcome of baseball games about 48% of the time. Literally worse than a coin. 

In STAT 231, we learn how to test claims and check for correlation and causation. How can we make the leap from correlation to causation? (Recommended reading: Freakanomics)

## Introduction to Data Analysis ##

Data can be classified into two categories: numerical and categorical (non-numerical).

**Numerical Data** is either discrete or continuous. Discrete data (e.g. number of accidents) takes integer values, while continuous data (e.g. height, weight) measure non-integer values.

**Categorical Data** is either ordinal (if there's an underlying order, e.g. on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being least satisfied and 10 being most satisfied) or non-ordinal (no order, e.g. nationality, favorite color).

**Transformation** {x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,..., x<sub>n</sub>}  
y<sub>i</sub> = f(x<sub>i</sub>) is a transformation.


An affine transformation is a linear transformation: y<sub>i</sub> = ax<sub>i</sub> + b

**Coding** is the conversion of categorical data into numerical data.

Data Summaries
--------------

We want to extract important information about data.

1. Numerical: come up with numbers that represent different properties of the data set
2. Graphical: graph that tells us the shape of the data set

There are some properties of interest:

+ Centre of the data set -> **Central Tendency**

+ How volatile is the data set -> **Dispersion**

+ If the data set is symmetric -> **Measures of Symmetry**

+ How "fat" the tails of the data set are (i.e. the size of extrema) -> **Kurtosis**

## Measures of Central Tendency

Data set: {y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>,..., y<sub>n</sub>}

**Sample Mean:** 

Property: The sum of the deviations of the observations from the sample mean is 0.

**Geometric Mean**

**Harmonic Mean**

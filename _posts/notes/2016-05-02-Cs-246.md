This course requires you to work in Linux. There are several options:

1. Lab machines  
2. Install Linux on your own machines  
3. Make SSH connection to school machines (Use Putty (putty.exe) on Windows, winscp for file transfer, XMing for Xwindows)  
4. Download cygwin - Linux-like environment for Windows
5. Get a Mac

**4 Modules in this Course:**

* Linux Shell (2 weeks)
* C++ Language, C++14 (10 weeks)  
* Tools
* Software Engineering (design etc.)

"Homework": Go on Piazza -> Linux Reference Sheet -> Save and print

Module 1: Linux Shell
---------------------

A shell is an interface to the operating system, i.e. how we get the OS to do things (run programs, manage files etc.). There are two kinds of shells: graphical (with icons and clicking) and the command line. The shell we will use is Bash. Check if you are using Bash, login to shell and type in:

    $ echo $0

It should return "bash".

**Linux file system: working with files**

**cat** - short for concatenate; display contents of a file (e.g. cat user/share/dict/words). In Linux, a directory is considered a special kind of file

**ls** - list files in the current directory (non-hidden files)

**ls -a** - list all files (including hidden; hidden files start with a ".")

**pwd** - print current directory (pwd = print working directory)

What happens when we only type in "cat"? It just kind of sits there, waiting for input. It's kinda like a parrot, repeating what you typed in. If we can capture the output into a file...

    $ cat > output.txt

It would capture the input. NOT RECOMMENDED: ^C. It would prevent cat from doing clean-up. Let it finish on its own: ^D at the beginning of a line sends an "EOF" signal to cat.

One greater than sign replaces, two appends.  
In general, command args > file
executes command args + captures the output in file -> called **output redirection**.

Using less than sign, takes in input from the file.

    $ cat < output.txt

The line above displays the file. Seems to be equivalent to what we have before. Are these two things the same? NO. The reason is very important:

* cat input.txt -> passes the NAME input.txt to cat as an argument. Cat opens input.txt and displays its contents

* cat < input.txt -> the shell opens the file and passes the contents to cat IN PLACE of keyboard input

**wc** - word count, displays numbers of lines, words, and characters of a file

**cat *.txt** - *.txt globbing pattern -> matches any sequence of characters (the shell finds all files that mathch the pattern)

**cat < *.txt** - ERROR! The shell will only attach one file to cat's input stream

Many (but not all) commands take both kinds of inputs:

**cat < input.txt > output.txt** - sends chars from input.txt to output.txt; effectively a copy-paste action

Every process is attached to 3 streams. Stdin goes into the program, stdout and stderr come out of the program. Stdin -> program -> stdout and stderr. By default, stdin = keyboard, stdout, stderr = screen.
< connects stdin to file, > connects stdout to file, 2> stdrr. Stderr separates output stream from error messages, so that output error messages can go to different places, and that error messages don't cut/block output files.

Also, stdout may be **buffered**. System may assemble characters before displaying. However, stderr isn't buffered, because user needs to see error messages immediately.

**Pipes**: Make one program's output(stdout) another program's input(stdin). Example: How many words occur in the first 20 lines of sample.txt?

    head -n file

gives the first n lines of file

    wc -w

counts words (just print the word count)

so

    head -20 sample.txt | wc -w

Here, | (the pipe symbol) makes the output of the command before it the input of the command after it.

To zip your assignment files, do:

    zip (directory where your files are).zip *

in the directory where the files are.


    marmoset_submit cs246 (question, e.g a0) (file you want to submit, zipped)

is how you submit assignments to Marmoset.

Suppose we have files words1.txt, words2.txt..., and each of them has one word per line. We want: A duplicate-free list of all the words used in any of these files

We need the following:

+ sort - sorts lines (man: Write sorted concatenation of all FILES(s) to standard output)
+ uniq - remove consecutive duplicate lines from input (man: filter adjacent matching lines from INPUT, writing to OUTPUT)

One possibility:

    cat words*.txt | uniq

What's the problem with this? We must sort our input first, because for aabaacd, it would produce abacd, with duplicates.

This should work:

    cat words*.txt | sort | uniq

Sort it first, then call uniq. But there's still a problem: it's way too inefficient, beacuse it cat(s) all the files together FIRST, and then sorts it.

This is better:

    sort words*.txt | uniq

Q: Is it possible to use the output onf one program as a __parameter__ to another?

Yes. E.g.

    echo "Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)"

The shell executes date and whoami, and subsitutes the results into the command line.

WARNING:

    echo 'Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)'

This will print the **LITERAL** interpretation, i.e. Today is $(date) and I am $(whoami)  
Single quotes do not execute the substitution.

    echo "$(ls words*.txt)"

prints a list of names of the text files:  
words1.txt  
words2.txt  
...

**Pattern Matching in Text Files**  
Use egrep (extended global regular expression print) = grep -E

    egrep pattern file

returns all lines that contain the pattern.

E.g. print lines that contain "cs246"

    egrep cs246 index.html

What about "cs246" OR "CS246"?

    egrep "cs246|CS246" index.html

The vertical bar (\|) means "OR", and the double quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the bar as a pipe.

We can use parentheses to group subexpressions together:

    egrep "(cs|CS)246" index.html

The patterns that egrep understands are called **regular expressions**. NOT globbing patterns.

"(c\|C)(s\|S)246" is equivalent to "[cC][sS]246"

**[...]** syntax says to match any SINGLE character in he square brackets. (a\|1\|c\|2) is equivalent to [a1c2].

**[^...]** matches any 1 character not in the square brackets.

"[cC][sS] ?246" allows for an optional space before the 246. ? syntax says to match 0 or 1 occurrences of the preceding expression.

\* syntax which matches 0 or more of the preceding expression. So (cs)\*246 -> 246, cs246, cscs246, cscscs246...  
cs(cs)*246 matches at least one cs at the front (eliminating the zero case)

(cs)+246 is equivalent to cs(cs)*246. The + syntax matches 1 or more of the preceding expression.

.* will match any sequence of characters

.+ will match any non-empty sequence of characters

"cs *246" matches any string starting with cs, followed by any string, followed by 246.

^ matches beginning of line

$ matches the end of line

^cs246 line starts with cs246

cs246$ line ends with cs246

Want all lines of even length

^(..)*$

The Other Section
===

Pipes allow us to hook the stdin of one program to the stdout of another. This is done using the pipe character \| between commands

    cmd1 args1 | cmd2 args2

**Regex Rules**:

+ Can use parentheses for a sub-pattern
+ Can use square brackets to match any one character in the square brackets
+ [^...] matches any one character EXCEPT those in the square brackets
+ A ? after a pattern or character represents 0 or 1 of that pattern/character
+ A * after a pattern/character represents 0 or more of that pattern/character
+ A + "1 or more"
+ . matches any SINGLE character
+ ^ and $ match the start and end of line respectively

E.g.  
.* - anything  
.+ - non-empty string  
^.+$ - all non-empty lines  
^.*$ - all lines  

^(..)*$ - grabs all lines with even number of characters

**Permissions**

* ls -l gives the long form listing of the files in the current directory  
* First 3 bits: Owner r-read w-write x-execute
* Middle 3 bits: Group
* Last 3 bits: Others
* r: ordinary files-> can be read, directories-> contents can be read, globbing workds, ls works
* w: ordinary files->can be modified, directories-> contents can be modified, add/remove
* x: file's contents can be executed as a program, directories->directories can be navigated (can cd into the directory)

**Changing Permissions**

* to change permissions use chmod

        chmod mode file

* mode is broken up to 3 parts - user, operator, and permissions
* user is either u (owner), g (group), o (other), or a (all)
* operator is either + (add), - (remove), = (set exactly)
* permissions are r, w, x

E.g.

    chmod o+r filename

gives other group read access to the file

    chmod o-r filename

is the reverse

    chmod a-r filename

then nobody can read it

    chmod u=rwx filename

then the owner can do anything with it.

**Shell Scripts**

A shell script is a file containing sequences of shell commands execueted as a program. For example if we wanted to print the date, current user, current dir.

    #!/bin/bash (this header tells the OS that this is a Bash script; allows the OS to interpret it the following as bash commands)
    date
    whoami
    pwd

.sh is the standard extension of a bash script, but you can put whatever you want. Don't forget permissions. Needs to be executable. Use chmod to give it executation rights.

**Variables**

+ Variables can be assigned with single equals.
+ x=1 (NO SPACES!!!)
+ use echo &{x} to grab the value of the variable x (parentheses run what's inside it in a "subshell") (curly braces are important: good practice)

**Shell Script Example**

Write a script that takes in a string to check if it is BAD. A string that can be found in a dict is bad.
General format of conditional statements in bash:

    if [ cond ]; then // the square brackets cannot "touch" what's inside
    ...
    elif [ cond ]; then
    ...
    else
    ...
    fi

**$?** contains the return value of the last-run command.
**$1** retrieves the first parameter

Create a .sh script as follows:

    #!/bin/bash

    egrep "^$1$" /usr/share/dict/words > /dev/null  # /dev/null is where data goes to DIE

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then //-eq compares
    echo Bad password
    else
    echo Maybe not the worst
    fi

And before you run it,

    chmod u+x goodpass.sh

In bash, the pound symbol (#) starts a comment.

Review:

    egrep pattern file

prints all lines in file that contain a match to pattern

**Shell Scripts Review**  

    #!/bin/bash  #"Shebang line"  
    date  
    whoami  
    pwd

To run the script in the current directory:

    ./myscript

**Variables**  

    x=1 #NO SPACES  
    echo $x #Use $ when fetching the value of a variable
    # No $ when setting a var ($ = "fetch the value of")
    # Good practice: ${x} - brace brackets, good style
    # All vars contain strings, e.g. x is the STRING 1, not the number/int

E.g.  
    dir = ~/cs246
    echo ${dir}
    /u/bmlushma/cs246 # get the absolute path
    ls ${dir} # contents of cs246

There are some global variables:  
    env # environment variables
    echo ${PATH} # list of directories (where the shell looks for programs)

When you type a command, the shell searches the list in order for a matching program.

    echo * # prints all files in the current directory
    echo "*" - suppresses globbing pattern
    echo '*' - suppresses globbing pattern
    echo "$PATH" # expands the quotes, $-expansion happens
    echo '$PATH' # absolutely literally

**Special Variables for Scripts**  
    $1, $2, ... # command-line arguments

E.g. check whether a word is in the dictionary

    ./isItAWord hello

    #!/bin/bash

    egrep "^$1$" /usr/share/dict/words # prints the word if found, prints nothing if not

E.g. a good password is not in the dictionary

    egrep "^$1$"/usr/share/dict/words > /dev/null # to black hole, suppress output
    # we could store the out in a variable
    x=$egrep ...

Note: every program returns a status code when finished: egrep returns 0 if found, 1 if not found (general convention in UNIX: 0 means success, non-0 means failure)

    $? # status of the most recently executed command

    if [ $? -eq 0]; then # the first square bracket is the name of a program, and what's inside the square brackets are its arguments
        echo Bad password
    else
        echo Maybe a good password
    fi

We want to verify that the user has inputted the correct number of arguments, and print a usage message if it's wrong

    #!/bin/bash

    usage() {
        echo "usage: $0 password" # $0 is the name of the script/program as it was typed
    }

    if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then # $# is the number of arguments
        usage
        exit 1
    fi

    egrep ... # as established above

Now this is a good program that can also check if the input is valid.

The general structure of conditional statements is as follows:

    if [ cond ]; then
        ...
    elif [ cond ]; then
        ...
    else
        ...
    fi

Comparisons to other conditions: Check the Linux reference sheet

**Loops**  

Loops: print the numbers from 1 to $1

    #!/bin/bash
    x=1
    while [ $x -le $1 ], do
        echo $x
        x=$((x+1)) # $(()) for arithmetic
    done

Looping over a list, e.g. rename all .cpp to .cc  

    #!/bin/bash
    for name in \*.cpp; do # for ... in sets the variable to each word in the given list
        mv ${name} ${name%cpp}cc # value of name, without trailing cpp
    done

e.g. how many times does word $1 occur in the file $2?

    #!/bin/bash
    x=0
    for word in $(cat "$2"); do #good idea - enclose vars in double quotes, prevent bad input
        if [ $word == $1 ]; then #String equality == instead of -eq
            x=$((x+1))
        fi
    done
    echo $x

e.g. Payday is the last Friday of the month. When is this month's payday?

2 tasks here: compute date and fomat the answer

    cal | awk '{print $6}' | egrep "[0-9]" | tail -1

Want: stdout and stderr in the same file

  printer >> out 2> out # works
  printer > out 2>> out #doesn't work

  #Alternatives
  printer &> out
  printer > out 2>&1
  printer 2>out 1>&2

Want: Give the top 10 most commonly used words

  sort wordCollection | uniq -c | head # problem
  sort wordCollection | uniq -c | sort | tail # works
  sort wordCollection | uniq -c | sort -k1,1rn -k2,2 | head # sort takes in arguments -k as key; 1,1 = first character r = reverse order(descending) n = sort in numerical order, 2 break ties
  sort wordCollection | uniq -c | sed 's_6_12_' | sort | tail # Use sed to replace 6s with 12s and then sort lexigraphically
  sort wordCollection | uniq -c | sed 's_6_12_' | sort -k1,1nr -k2,2 | head

egrep:

^ - match beginning of line  
$ - match end of a line  
^$, ^a$  
. - matches any single character  
? - matches preceeding pattern 0 or 1 times  
\* - 0 or more  
\+ - 1 or more  

Note: abc* != (abc)*
ab, abccc, abcccccc, in comparison to abc, abcabc, abcabcabc

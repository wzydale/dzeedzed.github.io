Time flies at university. High school already feels like ages ago, seriously. 

Looking back, I feel that I had a lot of crazy ideas when I was younger. Before deciding to go in to computer science, I really wanted to go into biology and become a pharmacologist. It all started in the summer of 2013, when I took the grade 11 level biology class in summer school in Vancouver. We got to dissect frogs, earthworms, and sashimi grade squids. Almost everyone else there was repelled by the scents of preserving alcohol and food remnants in the specimen's cavities. Except me. I thoroughly enjoyed it. During a field trip to the Vancouver General Hospital Disease Centre, I was the only one daring to look at a severed toe infected by gout. It was truly intriguing. 

People told me that "biology is not a real science" because most of it is, supposedly, just rote memorization of obscure Latin and Greek names of phyla and proteins. But I didn't think so, and finished the entire curriculum of grade 12 biology on my own in just two weeks after summer was over. Then I found out about a national biology competition, and promptly signed up for it. I read university textbooks on biochemistry, evolution, and cell biology. In my free time, I watched YouTube videos made by high school biology teachers.  I found a volunteering job as a museum educator at the [Beaty Biodiversity Museum](http://beatymuseum.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

And then I became interested in filmmaking and took the film and drama course.
